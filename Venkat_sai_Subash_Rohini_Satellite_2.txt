RS-D1 was a 38 kg experimental spin stabilized satellite designed with a power handling capability of 16W. It was launched onboard SLV-3 from SHAR Centre on May 31, 1981. The launch was a partial success as the satellite did not reach the intended height and thus it stayed in orbit for only 9 days. The satellite carried a solid-state camera using linear array of detectors for remote sensing applications.
