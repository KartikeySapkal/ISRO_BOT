          Technical Highlights:
         




           Handling of multiple satellite separation events
          

           Increased nominal mission duration
          

           Ensuring safe separation distance through C25 stage re-orientation and velocity
                                        addition
          

           Ensuring data availability for entire mission duration
          

           Realization of New payload adaptor and interface ring for the satellites

          OneWeb Constellation Summary:
         




           OneWeb Constellation operates in a LEO Polar Orbit
          

           Satellites are arranged in 12 rings (Orbital planes) with 49 satellites in each
                                        plane.
          

           The orbital planes are inclined to be near polar (87.9 Deg.)
          

           The orbital planes are 1200 km above the Earth
          

           Each satellite completes a full trip around the earth every 109 minutes.
          

           Theearth is rotating underneath satellites, so they will always be flying over
                                        new locations on the ground.
          

           In full service, each plane will have 49 satellites = 588 Satellites.
