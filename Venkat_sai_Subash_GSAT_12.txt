GSAT-12, the latest communication satellite built by ISRO, weighs about 1410 kg at lift-off. GSAT-12 was configured to carry 12 Extended C-band transponders to meet the country's growing demand for transponders in a short turn-around-time.

The 12 Extended C-band transponders of GSAT-12 augments the capacity in the INSAT system for various communication services like Tele-education, Telemedicine and for Village Resource Centres (VRC).
