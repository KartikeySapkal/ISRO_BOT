                   Payload Fairing
                  

                   The PSLV is capable of placing
																		multiple payloads into orbit, thus multi-payload
																		adaptors are used in the payload fairing. This
																		allowed the feat of launching 10 satellites into
																		different orbits in 2008, successfully launched
																		eight satellites into two different orbits in a
																		single mission from the First Launch Pad in 2016
																		and PSLV-C37 is the 39th flight launched the
																		Cartosat-2 series satellite and 103 co-passenger
																		satellites. More recently, on February 14th,
																		2022, PSLV C52 launched EOS-04, INS-2TD &
																		InspireSat-1 into their designated orbits
																		successfully
                  









                   PS4 s
                  

                   PS4 is the fourth and final
																		stage of pslv and it uses two liquid engines for
																		propulsion. PS4 is responsible for the correct
																		injection of PSLV's payloads into their
																		respective desired orbits.
                  









                   PS3
                  

                   PS3 is the third and
																		penultimate stage of PSLV, and it uses a HTPB
																		based propellant
                  









                   PS2
                  

                   PS2 IS THE SECOND STAGE OF
																		PSLV AND IS POWERED BY THE VIKAS LIQUID ENGINE,
																		DEVELOPED IN THE EARLY 90S.
                  









                   PS1
                  

                   PS1 is the first stage of PSLV
																		and it provides the launcher the high thrust
																		that is required for lift off. It uses the S139
																		solid rocket booster that contains 139 tonnes of
																		HTPB.
                  









                   Strap-on Boosters
                  

                   PSLV-XL uses 6 extended
																		strap-ons of 12 tonnes each, the PSLV-CA (core
																		alone version) does not use any strap-on motors,
																		PSLV-DL uses 2 and PSLV QL uses 4.

                  PSLV earned its title 'the
																	Workhorse of ISRO' through consistently delivering
																	various satellites to Low Earth Orbits. It can take
																	up to 1,750 kg of payload to Sun-Synchronous Polar
																	Orbits of 600 km altitude.

                 About the Launch Vehicle
                

                 Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle
																(PSLV) is
																the third generation launch vehicle of India.
																It is the first Indian launch vehicle to be equipped
																with
																liquid stages. After its first successful launch in
																October
																1994,
																PSLV emerged as a reliable and versatile workhorse
																launch
																vehicle of India. The vehicle has launched numerous
																Indian
																and foreign customer satellites.
																Besides, the vehicle successfully launched two
																spacecraft
																"Chandrayaan-1 in 2008 and Mars Orbiter Spacecraft in
																2013"that later travelled to Moon and Mars respectively.
																Chandrayaan-1 and MOM were feathers in the hat of PSLV.
																The
																launch of PSLV-C48 marks the 50th Launch of PSLV.

																Besides, the vehicle successfully launched two
																spacecraft "
																Chandrayaan-1 in 2008 and Mars Orbiter Spacecraft in
																2013"that later traveled to Moon and Mars respectively
                

                 PSLV earned its title 'the
																workhorse of
																ISRO' through consistently delivering various satellites
																into low
																earth orbits, particularly the IRS Series of satellites
                

                 Due to its unmatched reliability,
																PSLV
																has also been used to launch various satellites into
																Geosynchronous and Geostationary orbits,
																like satellites from the IRNSS Constellation
                

                 The PSLV is capable of placing
																multiple
																payloads into orbit, thus multi-payload adaptors are
																used in
																the payload fairing.
																The payload performance of the vehicle and mission
																flexibility is evident from the challenging missions
																where
																multi-orbit and multi-satellite missions
																are accomplished. The long string of consecutive
																successes
																and multi-satellite
																launch capability has reinforced the status of PSLV as a
																reliable, versatile and affordable launcher in the
																global
																market
