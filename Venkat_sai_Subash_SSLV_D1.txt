          ISRO developed a small satellite launch vehicle (SSLV) to cater to the launch of up to 500 kg satellites to Low Earth Orbits on a ‘launch-on-demand’ basis. SSLV is capable of launching Mini, Micro, or Nanosatellites (10 to 500 kg mass) to a 500 km planar orbit. SSLV provides low-cost access to Space on a demand basis. It offers low turn-around time, flexibility in accommodating multiple satellites, launch-on-demand feasibility, minimal launch infrastructure requirements, etc.
         

          The first developmental flight SSLV-D1/EOS-02 Mission was scheduled for August 7, 2022, at 09:18 am (IST) from the First Launch Pad of Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. SSLV-D1 was configured with three solid stages 87 t, 7.7 t and 4.5 t, where, the satellite insertion into the intended orbit would be achieved through a liquid propulsion-based velocity trimming module. SSLV-D1 is a 34 m tall, 2 m diameter vehicle having a lift-off mass of 120 t.
         

          SSLV-D1 was expected to launch EOS-02 and AzaadiSAT satellites. The vehicle, however, fell short of placing the satellites into their intended orbits. SSLV-D2, launched on February 10, 2023, became the first SSLV to launch satellites successfully.
