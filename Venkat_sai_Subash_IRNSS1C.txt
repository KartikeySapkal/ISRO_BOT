IRNSS-1C is the third navigation satellite of the seven satellites constituting the IRNSS space segment. Its predecessors, IRNSS-1A and IRNSS-1B were launched by PSLV-C22 and PSLV-C24 in July 2013 and April 2014 respectively. IRNSS-1C has a lift-off mass of 1425.4 kg. The configuration of IRNSS-1C is similar to that of IRNSS-1A and IRNSS-1B. The satellite has been realized in less than six months after the launch of its predecessor.

The satellite is powered by two solar arrays, which generate power up to 1,660 watts, and has a life-time of ten years. IRNSS-1C carries two types of payloads – navigation payload and ranging payload. The navigation payload of IRNSS-1C transmits navigation service signals to the users. This payload is operating in L5-band and S-band. A highly accurate Rubidium atomic clock is part of the navigation payload of the satellite. The ranging payload of IRNSS-1C consists of a C-band transponder which facilitates accurate determination of the range of the satellite. IRNSS-1C also carries Corner Cube Retro Reflectors for laser ranging.
