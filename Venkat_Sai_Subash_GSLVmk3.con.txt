                     S200 stage
                    


S200 strap on booster
																				is a 3.2 m diameter motor consisting of
																				3 segments of M250 motor case loaded
																				with 205 tonnes of HTPB based
																				propellant. Head segment is of shorter
																				length (3.0m) with propellant grain
																				having 13 lobbed star geometry and
																				middle and nozzle end segment are of
																				almost equal length (8.1m and 8.3m
																				respectively) with cylindrical grain
																				geometry with suitable taper to provide
																				longer tail off characteristics.
                    










                     L110 stage
                    

 The liquid L110 stage
																				uses a twin liquid engine configuration
																				with 115 tonnes of liquid propellant. It
																				is ignited at an alititude of 41.5km for
																				a burning duration of 200s (nominal)
                    










                     C25 stage
                    

 The upper stage in
																				LVM3 vehicle (2S200 + L110 + C25) is
																				cryogenic stage with 28 tonnes of
																				propellant loading (LOX /LH2) and
																				designated as C25. The C25 Stage is
																				powered with a 200 kN thrust (nominal)
																				engine working on gas generator (GG)
																				cycle. The command for C25 ignition is
																				issued soon after the separation command
																				for L110 stage and the stage burns for
																				about 646s. Stage has nominal diameter
																				of 4 m and overall height of 13.5 m with
																				dry mass of 4310 kg..

           About the Launch Vehicle
          

           LVM3 is configured as a three stage vehicle with two
										solid
										strap-on motors (S200), one liquid core stage (L110) and a high thrust cryogenic
										upper
										stage (C25). The S200 solid motor is among the largest solid boosters in the
										world with
										204 tonnes of solid propellant. The liquid L110 stage uses a twin liquid engine
										configuration
										with 115 tonnes of liquid propellant, while the C25 Cryogenic upper stage is
										configured with
										the fully indigenous high thrust cryogenic engine (CE20) with a propellant
										loading of 28 tons.
										The overall length of the vehicle is 43.5 m with a gross lift-off weight of 640
										tonnes and a 5m-diameter payload fairing. .
          

           LVM3 is the new heavy lift launch vehicle of
										ISRO for achieving a 4000 kg spacecraft launching
										capability to GTO (Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit) in a cost effective manner.
										LVM3 is a three stage launch vehicle consisting of two solid propellant S200
										strap-ons
										and core stages comprising of L110 liquid stage, C25 cryogenic stage, the
										equipment bay (EB) and the Encapsulated assembly (EA).
										EA comprises of the spacecraft, Payload Adaptor (PLA) and the Payload fairing
										(PF). With a lift-off mass of 640 tons, this 43.5 m
										tall three-stage launch vehicle gives ISRO full self-reliance in launching
										heavier communication satellites that weigh up to 4000 kg in GTO.
										The vehicle takes off with the simultaneous ignition of the two S200 boosters.
										The core stage (L110) is ignited at about 113s through the flight,
										during the firing of the S200 stages. Both S200 motors burn for about 134s and
										the separation occur at 137s. The payload fairing is separated at an altitude
										of 115 km and at about 217s during L110 firing. The L110 burnout and separation
										and C25 ignition occur at 313s.
										The spacecraft is injected into a GTO (Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit) orbit of
										180x36000 km at a nominal time of 974s.
