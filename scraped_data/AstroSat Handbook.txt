AstroSat mission
AstroSat – India’s first dedicated astronomy satellite
AstroSat spacecraft – actual view
To understand the nature of cosmic sources, their radiation processes and
environment, it is necessary to measure their emission over the entire
electromagnetic spectrum. Since intensity of most cosmic sources varies with
time, the variability being wavelength-dependent, it is necessary to make
simultaneous observations in different wavebands. Most of the current space
astronomy observatories are dedicated to a particular waveband e.g. X-ray, UV etc
and therefore, usually multi-wavelength studies have to be made from
coordinated observations with different satellites. There are logistical problems in
1
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
making simultaneous and coordinated studies of a specific object from different
satellites and ground-based telescopes. As a result, despite a large number of such
multiwavelength observation campaigns, very few sources have so far been
studied over wide spectral band leading to poor understanding of the underlying
physical processes. The most efficient and effective approach is to have a
dedicated satellite such as AstroSat with several co-aligned instruments covering
the desired spectral bands so that simultaneous observations in all the desired
wavebands is possible.
Wavelength coverage of AstroSat payloads
AstroSat spacecraft and five astronomy payloads covering optical, UV and X-rays
were designed, developed, realized and launched on 28th September 2015 by
PSLV-C30 (XL) from Sriharikota. The spacecraft was put in 650km near-equatorial
orbit with inclination of 6 degree. The payloads were switched ON in a sequence
and are operationalised.

ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
PSLV C-30 lift off from Sriharikota
The performance verification phase began in October 2015 and ended on 31
March 2016. Assessment of instrument performance, completion of initial
calibration, announcing the payload capabilities and release of first set of
calibration files were the aims of this phase.
First light observations were obtained with the Charged Particle Monitor (CPM) on
October 1, the Cadmium-Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) on October 6, Scanning Sky
Monitor (SSM) on October 12, three Large Area Xenon Proportional Counters
(LAXPCs) on October 19, Soft X-ray imaging Telescope (SXT) on October 26, and
the visible and UV telescopes on December 1, 2015.
Science observations by the payload teams were carried out from April to
September 2016. Currently, AstroSat is being operated as an observatory, in
which, the observatory time is allotted to proposers/ users.

Primary Science Objectives of AstroSat
Understand high energy processes in binary systems
Search for black hole sources in the Galaxy
Measure magnetic fields of neutron stars
Study high energy processes in extragalactic systems
Detect new transient X-ray sources
Limited high-angular resolution deep field survey in UV
These primary science objectives are being met with 5
science payloads.
Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters (LAXPC)
Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride Imager (CZTI)
Soft X-ray imaging Telescope (SXT)
Scanning Sky Monitor (SSM)
Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT)
The important parameters of the instruments are listed in the AstroSat payload
characteristics table (end of this chapter).
A complementary Charged Particle Monitor (CPM) is also onboard to provide
data on particle flux. The high voltage will be lowered or put off using data
from CPM when the satellite enters the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region to
prevent damage to the detectors as well as to minimize ageing effect in the
Proportional Counters.

AstroSat Payloads
 Three identical Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters (LAXPC)
covering 3-100 keV region for variability studies of X-ray Binaries and
other cosmic sources. It has four to five times more effective area
above 30 keV compared to the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) on
the Rossi X-ray timing Explorer (RXTE). (Primary goal – fast time
variability and wide band spectral coverage)
 Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride Imager (CZTI) array with coded mask
aperture extends the high energy limit (25-150 keV band) for spectral
studies. (extend high energy range, good spectral energy if no
source confusion; solid state detectors)
 Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) using X-ray reflecting mirrors and X-ray
CCD for timing and variability studies in 0.3 – 8.0 keV band (Soft X-ray
energies; imaging in X-rays)
 Scanning Sky Monitor (SSM) for detection and monitoring of new and
known X-ray sources in 2.5 – 10 keV region.
 Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) to image the sky
simultaneously in three wavelengths, one covering the FUV band
(130 – 180 nm) and the second sensitive in NUV (200 – 300nm) and
Visible (320 – 550 nm) bands. Image resolution is ~ 1.5” in near UV
compared to ~ 6” of GALEX. (NUV, FUV and Optical imaging; intensity
variation).
UVIT payload has collaboration with Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and
SXT is in collaboration with University of Leicester, UK.
Uniqueness of AstroSat

Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope
I
maging in the ultra-violet regime with a spatial resolution of 1.8” ( ~ X 3 better than Galex) in a field of
~ 28’ provides many opportunities for Galactic and extra-galactic studies. Some of the objectives are
listed below:
a) Time variations in UV of X-ray sources in coordination with the X-ray payloads
b) Star formation in nearby galaxies
c) Star formation in interacting galaxies
d) Star formation history of universe
e) Hot stars in Globular clusters
f) Planetary nebulae
Instrument Overview
UVIT is primarily an imaging instrument. Images are made simultaneously in three channels: FUV (130-180
nm), NUV (200-300 nm), and VIS (320-550 nm), in a field ~ 28’ circle. The spatial resolution (FWHM) is < 1.8”
for the FUV and NUV channels, and it is ~ 2.2” for the VIS channel. In each channel, a set of filters are
available, in the filter-wheels, for selecting a band. In the two ultraviolet channels, gratings are provided for
low resolution (~ 100) slitless spectroscopy. The focussing optics is configured as twin R-C telescopes, each
with a primary mirror with with effective diameter of ~ 375 mm.
The overall structure is shown in Fig. 2.1. Those parts of the telescopes which define locations of the optical
elements are mostly made of Invar36, and the other parts are made of Aluminium alloy. The two telescopes
are mounted on a cone-like structure of Titanium, which is attached to central cylinder of the spacecraft.
A cylindrical baffle extends over each of the telescopes for attenuating the radiation from off-axis sources.
With these baffles the light reaching the detector from sources at 45 deg. from the axis is attenuated by a
factor 109; with such attenuation the light reaching the detector from full Moon at 45 deg from the axis is less
than the average sky background. In addition to these baffles, the doors act as sun shades as long as Sun is at
> 45 deg from the axis and the plane containing the optical axis and normal to the doors.
In order to avoid contamination of the optics due to ultraviolet assisted reactions, bright-earth is kept away
from the axis by >12 deg., and the sun is kept behind the sun-shield at all times even if UVIT is not observing.
8
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
The geo-coronal lines are very strong in day time, and a significant amount of solar radiation could be
scattered by the other instruments on the spacecraft into the baffles. Therefore, the nominal observation
period is restricted to the night time (In special cases, observations in day time could be considered).
The intensified CMOS detectors can either be used in a high gain photon counting mode, or in a low gain
integration mode (in which signal in a pixel of the CMOS detector could be contributed by multiple photons).
Pointing accuracy of the spacecarft is ~ 3’, and for any pointing the aspect could drift by several tens of
arcsec, at rates < 0.2”/s. In order to eliminate effect of this drift on the PSF, multiple short exposures (< 1 s
each) are taken and are combined using shift and add. As the VIS field has adequate number of bright
sources, images (taken in integration mode) from this channel are used to estimate the drift as a function of
time.
There are three main contributors to the PSF: optics, detector, and drift of the aspect. Of these three the
largest contribution is made by the detector and it is ~ 1” FWHM. The estimated overall FWHM, including the
contributions of the optics and the drift, is 1.5”.
The peak effective area, excluding the losses in the filters, is: ~ 15 cm2 for the FUV, and ~ 50 cm2 for NUV &
VIS. An exposure calculator is available to estimate the expected signal levels for point sources observed
through the various filters. In addition, a simulator is available which can generate the output image expected
from an observation with UVIT, for an extended source with known distribution of the intensity.

Optics
Optical layouts of the two telescopes are are shown in Fig. 2.2 & Fig. 2.3. Both telescopes have hyperbolic
f/4.5 primary mirrors of diameter ~ 380 mm (optical diameter ~ 375 mm), and hyperbolic secondary mirrors
of optical diameter 140 mm. The overall focal length of the telescopes is ~ 4750 mm. The reflective coatings
are Al with MgF layer. The expected reflectivity is: ~ 70% per surface in FUV, and > 80% per surface in NUV &

VIS. Roughness of the coated surfaces is < 1.5 nm rms, to keep the scattering < 1% per surface.

detector has a diameter of ~ 40 mm. The filters, each of diameter 50 mm, and the grating are mounted in a wheel at a
distance of ~40 mm from the detector.
The plate scale is ~ 43“/mm. With a surface figure better than 1/50 waves rms (at 632 nm) for each of the
mirrors, the PSF includes > 60% energy in diameter 1” at all wavelengths. In the NUV/VIS telescope, a beam
splitter is used to reflect NUV and transmit VIS. Transmission leads to aberration in the VIS beam, and a
cylindrical lens in used to reduce the aberration below 2” FWHM.

Detectors
All the three detectors are intensified CMOS type with an aperture of ~ 40 mm diameter. Construction of the
three detectors and their electronics are identical except for the photo-cathodes and the window. A 5 mm
thick MgF window is used for the FUV detector, while 5 mm thick silica windows are used for the NUV and
2
the VIS detectors. A sketch of the detector module is shown in Fig. 2.19

DETECTOR MODULE
CMOS-IMAGER
Each 25 micron pixel
is ~ 3” x 3”
Fibre-taper
~ 3 : 1
Phosphor
Housing
Fig. 2.19 : Configuration of the detector module is shown. At the bottom, and hidden by the housing, are the 5 mm thick
window with photo-cathode deposited on it, and a set of two micro-channels-plates for multiplication ( by up to about a
million) of the photo-electron. The electrons are accelerated by ~ 5 kV and strike the phosphor to emit a pulse of photons.
The light from phosphor is transmitted to Star-250 (C-MOS Imager) by a fibre-taper. The fibre-taper also matches the 40
mm diameter of the window to size of the C-MOS Imager (512 X 512 pixels of 25 X 25 microns).
Gap between the photo-cathode and micro-channel-plates is kept small (~ 0.1 mm ) to minimize drift of the
photoelectrons. With such small gaps, contribution of the detectors to the PSF is no more than ~ 1” FWHM.
The detectors can either be operated in photon counting mode (with a very high multiplication by the micro-
channel-plates) where a list of coordinates of centroids of the detected photons is transmitted, or in
integration mode with the multiplication kept at a low value where the raw frame of CMOS is transmitted.
Typically the ultraviolet detectors are used in photon counting mode and the visible detector is used in
integration mode. Either the entire array of 512 X 512 pixels can be read, at a max. rate of ~29 frames/s, to
capture the full field, or a part of the field can be read in “window” mode at rates up to ~600 frames/s,
depending on area of the window.
Thermal Effects
Variations in temperature can effect observations in several ways. Relative thermal expansion shifts focus of
the telescope, and surface of the mirrors can get distorted. To minimize these effects, temperature of the
telescopes is kept 200 +- 30 C and the structure is made of Invar. The mirrors are mounted on flexible supports
made of Invar to minimize thermal stresses. There is no provision for adjustment of the focus in orbit, but the
effect of temperature variations on the focus is expected to be small.
22
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
Transmission of the filters/gratings and quantum efficiency/gain of the detectors too can change with
temperature. The temperature of these elements is kept in range 150 C to 300 C. The thermal effects are not
calibrated on ground. As the photon counting mode is not very sensitive to the gain of the detector, this
mode is affected less than the integration mode.
Correction for the drift is based on assuming that there is no relative drift between the three channels.
Temperature variations can lead to relative drift between the channels, and this can only be modeled with in-
orbit data.
Backgrounds
UVIT background has several sources. These are discussed below.
a) Dark counts in the detector:
At 20 degree C the dark photon counts are (as per the test data from Photek, UK , who supplied the CPUs
of the detector systems):
VIS NUV FUV
1266/s 50/s 8/s
b) Bright limb of earth
At angles less than 45 from the axis, bright earth can give background which is in excess of the Zodiacal
light.
c) Zodiacal light
Zodiacal light is ~ mag 22 per sq arcsec in the V band. This corresponds to ~ 5 x10-18 erg/(s A cm2 arcsec2) or ~
0.08 detected photons per second per sq arcsec for an effective area of 50 sq cm for a band 5500 A to 6500 A.
This background falls very slowly between 6000 A and 3000 A and it falls very fast at the shorter wavelengths.
The photon flux per A is less by ~ 6 (300) at 3000 A (2000 A) as compared to that at 6000 A. These estimates
are based on the data in “Chapter 6 of STIS Instrument Handbook for Cycle 21”., and the reader may find more
information on backgrounds from this source.
d) Geocorona
Geocoronal lines are excited by solar radiations and vary in intensity by large factors. Typical counts of
detected photons in the detectors, without filter, are listed below:
Geocoronal Counts per second
Line FUV Detector NUV Detector
(Effective Area 15 Sq cm) (Effective Area 50 Sq cm)
Night Day Night Day
1216 A Ly ά 129000 1290000
1304 A OI 860 129000
1356 A OI 64 12900
2471 A OII < 170 < 34000
23
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
It is clear that due to these lines observations cannot be made during the daytime in FUV channel. Further,
the CaF filter (the widest band filter in FUV) could have leak of a few percent for Ly ά, and the nighttime
2
counts could be in range ~ 1000/s to 5000/s. The estimates in table are based on the data in “Chapter 6 of STIS
Instrument Handbook for Cycle 21”., and the reader may find more information on backgrounds from this source.
Photon Counting and Integration Modes
The detectors can operate in two distinct modes:
i) Photon Counting Mode
ii) Integration Mode
In the photon counting mode, a very high multiplication is obtained in the MCPs such that each photo-
electron generated in the short exposure (<100 ms) is detected as a light pulse in the CMOS imager, and its
centroid is found. Thus, for each frame of exposure a list of centroid-positions is obtained from the detector.
The expected spatial resolution in this mode is < 1.8” FWHM. If in a single exposure two or more photon
events occur within a separation ~< 3 pixels of the CMOS imager (~ < 10”), these are detected as a single
event or rejected as unacceptable event (see later discussion on choice of modes).
In the integration mode, multiplication of the MCPs is kept low, and signals in all the pixels of the CMOS
detector are obtained. In this mode, many (weak) pulses of light, from many photo-electrons, could fall at the
same location; the signal at any location is a measure of how many photo-electrons were detected. The
expected spatial resolution in this mode is ~ 5” FWHM.
For imaging full field, minimum exposure time is ~ 34 ms. Therefore, given the background levels, imaging in
the VIS channel in photon counting mode would lead to overlapping photon events. Further, the total flux of
visible photons is such that in photon counting mode life of the MCPs would be exhausted in about one year.
Hence, imaging in the VIS channel is normally done in integration mode.
Operational Constraints
Avoidance of ram-angle, Sun, and bright-Earth for safety:
In order to avoid any damage to coating of the primary mirror, due to atomic oxygen, a minimum angle of 120
is kept between the ram direction and the roll-axis, i.e. axis of UVIT. In order to avoid damage/UV-assisted
contamination due to radiation from Sun/bright-Earth/Moon, a minimum angle of 450 / 120/150 is kept
between the axis and Sun / bright-Earth/Moon at all times even if UVIT is not observing.
Avoidance of bright objects:
Every field to be observed is checked for avoidance of very bright objects in a neighborhood of 20 radius; from
20., 1 part in 104 of the FUV flux could be scattered in the field.
24
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
Saturation with bright objects:
Any bright object which can give a detected photon count rate >1 count pr frame per ~ 10” X 10” would see
serious saturation effects. Thus, to observe relatively bright objects in photon-counting mode a high frame
rate can be used with partial field of view. (Minimum exposure time for the full field is ~ 34 ms, and it is ~ 2
ms for a field of 6’ X 6’.
Choices in Photon Counting Mode and Integration Mode
The nominal mode of observations for the ultraviolet channels is photon counting. Due to its large
background, nominal mode of observations in the visible channel is integration mode with a low gain of MCP.
To observe bright sources in the ultraviolet, either a high frame rate with a reduced (windowed) field can be
used or the integration mode can be used. (As mentioned earlier, the spatial resolution in the integration
mode is ~ 5” as compared to < 1.8” in the photon counting mode.)
In the photon counting mode a set of choices are available, in the hardware of the detector system, for
selecting: a) thresholds for signals, in the pixels of Star250, to define a genuine photon event, and thus reject
noise; a large threshold would reduce effective quantum efficiency, while a small threshold would bring in
more noise-events, b) choice of centroiding algorithm for the events from a 3 square/5 square/3 cross
windows. In addition, during the ground processing, a threshold can be set for rejecting bright pixels at the
corners of the events to eliminate close pairs of photon events – this is required to minimize errors in
determination of position of the centroid.
In the integration mode, the hardware allows selection of the gain of MCP by control of the high voltage.
Thus, for a very bright source a very low gain can be selected to avoid saturation of the pixels of Star250.
Observing in Partial Fields
For the full field (~ 28’ circle), the maximum double frame rate is ~ 29/s. For those sources which have an
intensity > ~ 5 photons/s/(10” X 10”), many frames would have close double photon events at this frame rate.
In order to avoid double photon events for such sources a higher frame rate can be obtained by selecting a
partial field for observations: the field is selected in units of pixels of Star250. The maximum frame rate is
roughly in inverse proportion to area of the field. Thus, given the full field as 512 X 512 pixels, a rate of >600
frames/s is obtained for a field 100 X 100 pixels.
Choice is provided for the following sizes of partial fields, centered on the axis:
1. 100 X 100
2. 150 X 150
3. 200 X 200
4. 250 X 250
5. 300 X 300
6. 350 X 350
7. 512 X 512
In Photon Counting, frame rate is fixed at
1. ~ 640/s for 100X 100
2. ~ 300/s for 150 X 150
25
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
3. ~ 180/s for 200 X 200
4. ~ 115 /s for 250 X 250
5. ~ 82/s for 300 X 300
6. ~ 61/s for 350 X 350
7. ~29/s for 512 X 512.
Caution:
In window mode the data rate can be very high as each frame carries an overhead of 4kBytes and the
maximum data rate allowed for the total of FUV and NUV images is 10 Gbits/orbit. The ex[osures asked for
should respect this limit, i.e. for each orbit the total data for FUV and NUV images should be such that
((Number of FUV frames + Number of NUV frames) * 32000 + Time of exposure * 500000) < 1010.
If Integration is selected, exposure time per frame can be selected as per the following:
1. For 100 X 100: in range 0.02 s to 0.30 s, steps of 0.02s
2. For 150 X 150: in range 0.05 s to 0.45 s, steps of 0.02s
3. For 200 X 200: in range 0.08 s to 0.65 s, steps of 0.02s
4. For 250 X 250: in range 0.12 s to 0.80 s, steps of 0.05s
5. For 300 X 300: in range 0.17 s to 0.95 s, steps of 0.05s
6. For 350 X 350: in range 0.25 s to 1.10 s, steps of 0.05s
7. For 512X 512: in range 0.50 s to 1.70 s , steps of 0.1s
Please note that all these options for integration mode are not operational. The only options available are :
For VIS :
only 512x512 window size, and with averaging of {16} frames for transmission, with ROW_GAP_TIME
adjusted to achieve a frame_time of ~ 0.94 s for the averaged frame.
Please note that the design allows for selection of partial field of any size and at any position of the full field.
However, for simplifications of the operations only some choices of square shaped partial fields, around the
centre, are given. An off-centre partial field would call for a certain orientation of the field in addition to
correct pointing of the axis, while safety of UVIT require that the field be oriented such that the sun is behind
the doors.
Timing Observations
While the main focus of UVIT is not for timing observations, it is possible to record absolute time of each
photon event, along with its position, with an accuracy < 5 ms. For such observations, the analysis on ground
would generate a time series of all the detected photons along with their positions on the sky.

Modes of operation of UVIT
Description of Filter-Detector systems:
A brief description of the UVIT's Detector-Filter system will help comprehend the details of their OPERATION,
which is somewhat complex. It will also help clarify the various acronyms used in the text.
The UVIT Filter system (for each of the 3 channels) consists of two distinct physical sub-units : Filter-Wheel-
Motor Assembly (FWMA) & Filter-Wheel Drive Electronics (FWDE). The FWMA is located between the back of
the primary mirror of the telescope and the Detector system. The FWDE is located on the spacecraft deck
(inside the cuboid structure). Electrical signals run via ~ 4.5-m long cables between the FWDE & FWMA via a
patch-board located near the focal volume of the 2 telescopes. All 3 FWDE units are housed inside the same
mechanical enclosure / box.
The Detector assembly (for each of the 3 channels) consisting of the intensifier tube, fiber-optic-taper, CMOS
image sensor and its fan-out board, electrical connectors & HV cables, is termed as 'Camera Proximity Unit'
(CPU). The CPU is located at the focal plane of the respective channel (at the back of the telescopes; behind
the primary). The High Voltage Unit (HVU) for the corresponding channel which generates the 3 voltages
(V_PC, V_MCP & V_A), is located near CPU itself minimizing the lengths of the HV cables. The HV cables are an
integral part of the CPU & connect to the HV connectors on the body of the HVU. The drive electronics for the
27
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
CMOS sensor as well as the signal processing (including centroiding) is located in a separate unit called 'Read-
out Electronic Assembly' (REA) located on the spacecraft deck (similar to FWDE). All 3 REA units for the 3
channels are housed inside a single mechanical enclosure / box, called the Electronics Unit (EU). The electrical
cables between REA & CPU are through long cables via the patch-board (see above). Similarly REA & HVU are
electrically connected through similar long cables via the patch-board. It is important to note that while all
commands for Filter system (FWDE) are through conventional dedicated conductors between spacecraft
system (Bus Management Unit, BMU) and the FWDE, carrying relevant electrical signals (for Pulse or Data
commands), the control of various selectable parameters of the Detector & related read-out Electronics
system as implemented within each REA, is programmed via the serial (1553B) communication link with the
spacecraft sub-system BMU.
While all the science data from the Detector system flow through the spacecraft's Data Handling Unit (DHU),
the status of the Filter wheel are available exclusively through the Low Bit-rate Telemetry (LBT).
Modes of the Detector :
Each of the 3 Detector sub-systems (corresponding to the 3 wavelength channels) are identical in regard to
the 'Modes' in which they can be at any given time. The modes are like 'states' and they are named as :
a) Off
b) Low Power
c) Standby
d) Active
e) Bright Object Detected
f) Fail Safe
In 'Off' mode, all three units REA, HVU & the CPU are in powered off state. Only a discrete pulse command
can take the detectors sub-system from 'Off' state to 'Low Power' state.
In 'Low Power' state, the REA is powered but the HVU and the CPU are still off, and 1553B communication
line is now operational (ready to accept commands & respond to telemetry requests from the BMU).
Using a 'change-state' command via 1553B link, the detector can be taken from the 'Low Power' mode to
'Standby' mode and vice-versa. In this 'Standby' mode, in addition to the REA, the HVU and the CPU are also
powered on (however, all the three control voltages of the HVU, viz., for Photo-Cathode, Micro-Channel-Plate
& Anode are Low/zero).
In order to attain full functionality (of imaging), the detector system must be taken from 'Standby' mode to
'Active' mode via a 1553B command. Once in 'Active' mode, issuance of 'Star Imaging' with all the imaging
parameters, initiates ramping up of the HVU & imaging as per programmed parameters. The science data
stream now starts feeding the DHU sub-system. The imaging can be stopped by issuing a 'Stop Imaging'
command (without leaving the 'Active' mode, meaning that we can re-start imaging with say, some different
imaging parameters) or directly making a state-change to 'Standby'. All imaging is carried out in 'Active' mode
only. Imaging parameters can be loaded only by the 'Start Imaging' command.
From the above, it should be clear that only certain sequences of changes of state of the detector system are
meaningful (as evident from the state-diagram - Fig. 2.21 & Table 2.5). On receipt of any command implying
28
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
departure from the allowed sequences, the command is ignored - and a suitable error flag raised for follow up
safety actions by the BMU.
Table 2.5: State table of the detector system for exception cases
Emergencies
Emergencies related to the Detectors
Recovery from any of the emergencies described here, involve action from ground station (i.e. there is no
auto-recovery based on onboard logic).
1. While imaging, a Bright Object Detected (BOD) flag is generated in case certain conditions (above
selectable thresholds) are encountered. These thresholds are: (i) intensity level (event height), (ii)
size (event length in pixels along one axis) & (iii) persistence of this condition (over successive
number of frames; to avoid 'false alarm'). The BOD flag/alarm is a 1bit hardware logic signal over a
dedicated line (per UVIT channel), which is periodically monitored by the spacecraft system BMU. On
receipt of BOD alarm, the BMU suspends all previously planned operations of UVIT & takes necessary
action (issuance of commands) to take all 3 channels of UVIT into a 'safe' state. This includes: parking
the filter wheels in 'light Block' condition, taking each of the 3 REAs to finally 'Low Power' mode via
intermediate steps.
2. Another form of 'alarm'/emergency, possibly related to bright objects in the field is: Over Current
(OC) of any of the High Voltage supplies. In this case, the channel detecting OC itself goes in to 'Low
Power' mode & signals a flag to the BMU in the LBT telemetery (one bit in the1553B frame). BMU on
receipt of the OC flag, will take action sequence leading to Power Off for all 3 channels (the sequence
includes : suspension of all previously planned operations of UVIT; safe parking of filter wheels; all
relevant intermediate steps to arrive at the Power Off' condition).
3. Yet another form of 'alarm'/emergency (possibly related to high charged particle background), occurs
when the onboard electronics detects a Single Event Latchup (SEL) situation. The affected channel
itself moves to a FAILSAFE state (with its secondary power system internally disabled), while the BMU
29
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
detects this state from its periodic monitoring of the supply (+3.3 V) line. The BMU then takes all 3
channels to Power Off state following the usual sequence of intermediate steps.
4. An additional type of emergency occurs, when the 1553B command acknowledgment frame received
from REA, has any one (or more) of the 'errorflagbits' in 'set' state. This implies at least one of the
programmed selectable imaging parameters is 'wrong' (incompatible with current state) & hence that
command frame has been ignored by REA. This means an error has occurred possibly in the mission
planning software & hence the UVIT operations need to be shutdown till the cause is understood
(just like any of the emergencies). On encountering this kind of emergency, the BMU takes all 3
channels to 'Low Power' state via usual sequence of intermediate steps.
5. Housekeeping values out of acceptable range : when any of the few selected temperatures & power
supply voltages is found to be out of its acceptable operating range, this emergency is triggered.
Although this out-of-range condition may have been detected in one channel, all the 3 detector
systems of all the 3 channels are taken to 'Low Power' state via usual sequence of intermediate steps.
Emergencies related to the Filter wheels:
In case the filter wheel status shows abnormality (e.g. being in 'acquire'/slewing state for a time much longer
than normal), BMU takes all 3 channels of UVIT to 'Low Power' state via usual sequence of intermediate steps
(including parking the filters to 'light block' configuration).
Typical Observing Sequence
From the safety point of view of the UVIT payload, during all slews of the spacecraft, the Filter wheel is
parked at the SAFE ('lightblock') configuration. Even when a UVIT channel is not being used for any
observations, that channel is normally left in 'Standby' mode [this is to minimize the number of hard OnOff
cycles over the mission life].
A typical observation sequence (for exposure with one filter) consists of the following steps [starting with
filter at 'SAFE' parked configuration and Detector in 'StandBy' state, as stated above; assuming imaging in
Photon Counting mode] :
The spacecraft (BMU) verifies that:
(A) the UVIT is presently in a 'SAA Safe ZONE'
(B) selected UVIT health parameters (temperatures & supply voltage monitors) are within allowed range
(C) the spacecraft attitude (AOCS) is at the target position
(1) Change state of the REA from 'Standby' to 'Active' mode;
(2) Collect DARK1 (for Star250 C-MOS imager) Image frames in Integration Mode, and High Voltages
'Low' [this involves 'Start Imaging', data collection & 'Stop Imaging' sequence of operations];
(3) Move from 'Active' state to 'StandBy';
(4) Prepare the Filter Wheel for motion by issuing 'Safe Reset';
(5) Move the Filter Wheel by issuing 'Target angle' (Filter selection for this observation);
30
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
(6) 'Kill time' for sufficient duration so that the Filter would have reached the destination;
(7) Disable Filter Wheel Motor (coils de-energized) to save power;
(8) Move from 'StandBy' to 'Active' state;
(9) Begin Imaging by issuing 'Start Imaging' command, which includes all imaging parameters;
(10) 'Kill time' appropriate for the duration of the current exposure;
(11) Issue the 'Stop Imaging' command;
(12) Move from 'Active' state to 'StandBy';
(13) Park the Filter Wheel in SAFE ('lightBlock') configuration;
(14) 'Kill time' for sufficient duration so that the Filter would have reached the destination;
(15) Disable Filter Wheel Motor (coils de-energized) to save power;
(16) Move from 'StandBy' to 'Active' state;
(17) Collect DARK2 (for Star250 C-MOS imager) Image frames in Integration Mode, and High Voltages
'Low' [this involves 'Start Imaging', data collection & 'Stop Imaging' sequence of operations];
(18) Move from 'Active' state to 'StandBy';
[Now the channel is back to its starting position; Detector (REA) in 'StandBy' & Filter wheel at 'SAFE'.]
Observations in Daytime
The backgrounds in daytime, due to geocorona and due to scatterings in ASTROSAT, are very large. However,
in specific cases observations during the daytime are possible, with reduced sensitivity, as long as the sun is >
45 deg. away from the field and limb of the earth is > 12 deg. away.
Optimisation for calibration with multiple nearby pointings in multiple filters
Change of a filter takes ~ 30 s. In addition, before every change of the filter the high voltages on the detector
are taken to zero and then ramped up after the new filter is in position, which takes another ~30 s. Thus,
observations for flat-field calibrations, by placing the calibration source at different parts of the field
separated by < 10’, can be finished in one filter by changing pointing before changing to the next filter. In
case the sources are far from each other, the largest overhead would be time to change pointing and it is best
to finish all the observations on one object before moving to the next.
Quantum Efficiencies
Quantum efficiencies of the detectors have been measured in photon counting mode, with reference to a
NIST calibrated photo-diode. These are shown in Fig. 2.22.

Calibration details
The calibration of the UVIT instrument is achieved through ground-based as well as in-orbit tests. The
individual components of the UVIT instrument are tested and calibrated in the ground. The performance of
the integrated system is tested during the performance verification phase after the launch. The results are
presented below.
35
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
Ground based tests:
Detectors:
The CMOS-intensified imagers used in the three UVIT channels are tested at the Canadian facility in the
University of Calgary, and at Indian Institute of Astrophysics at Bengaluru. The tests performed on the
detector include tests for quantum efficiency as a function of wavelength, spatial variation of sensitivity, tests
to estimate the centroid of the photons detected, gain as a function of MCP voltage etc., and distortions.
These tests were done on both the EM and the FM detectors. Many of these results have been summarized in
the preceding subsections, and to that we can add: a) based on the measurements on witness samples,
reflectivity of the mirrors is estimated as ~ 70% in FUV and ~ 80% in NUV and VIS, b) any variability in
sensitivity, on scales < 20 mm, is <5%.
All the details will be included in the calibration database.
Filters and gratings:
The EM and the FM filters are tested for their transmission and its spatial variability. No variability of > 5% is
found, except for NUV-filter B15 which shows a variability of ~ 30% (see Fig. 2.9). The gratings are tested for
dispersion and spectral transmission in different orders. The results have been summarised in preceding
subsections.
Effective Areas
The parameters estimated above are integrated together to estimate the overall effective areas for the
various filters ( see Figs. 2.23, 2.24, and 2.25) . These are incorporated in the exposure time calculator. The
calculator estimates the expected counts/sec for any object, when one provides its spectral energy
distribution (or equivalent). This will be used to estimate the exposure times by the users at the time of
proposal submission.
Integrated telescopes
Several tests have been done on the assembled telescopes. These tests show the following: a) in photon
counting mode, FWHM of the PSF is less than 1.8” for all the filters through the field of 28’, b) the effective
areas match the estimated (based on the measurements on individual components) values within 25%, c)
centres of NUV (FUV) and VIS detectors match within 15” (30”), d) scattered light from out of field sources, at
0.5 deg and at 1 deg., shows no ghosts and the background per 10 square arcsec is attenuated by >19 mag..

separation between images in VIS are related to those in FUV/NUV by equations:
dxf = 0.85734 dxv - 0.57706 dyv & dyf = 0.57706 dxv + 0.85734 dyv
dxn = 1.03458 dxv - 0.04366 dyv & dyn = - 0.04366 dxv - 1.03458 dyv
where dxv/dxf/dxn are shifts/separations along “x” in VIS/FUV/NUV etc. in pixels Star250, and dya/dpi are
rotations of the payload on Yaw/Pitch axis in arcseconds. (Note that each pixel of Star250 corresponds to ~ 75
X 75 micron in the focal plane.)

In orbit calibrations:
This subsection describes the overall goals of the in-orbit calibration and outlines a set of calibration tasks.
A calibration task is the configuration, observation and analysis required to calibrate a specific aspect of the
instrument. The primary goal of this calibration is to ensure that the scientific quantities obtained from the
UVIT instrument conform to the requirements set forth by the instrument document. This also needs to fulfill
the requirements set forward by the science projects.
UVIT-in orbit calibration is designed to allow automated processing of UVIT data by the pipeline with the goal
of producing a calibrated set of images and spectra which can be used for quantitative data analysis in order
to achieve the scientific objectives. The activities listed in this document pertain to four types of calibrations.
Photometric calibration will yield a conversion of a measured count rates into a broadband flux for any given
filter-detector combination. The spectroscopic calibration consists of estimation of wavelength coverage,
dispersion and flux calibration. Distortion calibration is the measurement of detector distortion andangular
separation across the detector. The relation between a point on the detector based on the image created by
the telescopes and the absolute position in the sky will be used to estimate distortion as well as the imgage
scale across the field. Photometric point sources will used to find PSF of the instrument for short exposures
(which are not affected by drift of the S/C) and for long exposures (which are affected by drift of the S/C, and
depend on how well the drift is corrected during the processing on ground). Timing calibrations will also be
performed.
The in-orbit tests are performed during the performance verification (PV) phase of ASTROSAT. The total
exposure time required for these is approximately one month. The photometric calibration tasks along with
the other calibration will be performed in this time. The in-orbit calibration tasks will be performed during the
PV phase and repeated at regular intervals to monitor any drifts in
the performance of the system as well as to improve the already estimated parameters. Hence, some of the
calibration activities or tasks will be repeated at regular intervals. As per the recommendations of the
monitoring team, certain calibration tasks may be included while planning the observing cycles also.
The following table summarises various calibration tasks planned to be taken up during the PV phase and
later:
1. Photometric zero-point calibration (FUV, NUV, VISUAL):
2. Photometric standard stars with flux calibrated spectra in the 1300-3500A will be used. The standard
star will be observed in the central field in all filters to obtain the flux calibration. Sources which are
faint enough to have minimal saturation will be chosen.
3. Secondary photometric calibration (FUV, NUV, VIS):
The photometric standard stars which are moderately bright be observed in the center and 8
more locations around the center to estimate the variation in zero-point across the field, in all
filters.
4. Calibration of the gratings for dispersion and effective area (FUV, NUV):
Sources such as WR stars or PN with strong emission line spectrum in the UV region will be
used to estimate the wavelength coverage and dispersion relation for the two FUV gratings
and one NUV grating.
5. Distortion and estimation of image scale across the field: Rich star clusters with UV bright stars and
well defined astrometric position will be used. As this depends on the detector, observation in one
filter per channel will be obtained.
37
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
6. Plate scale and relation between the coordinate system of the detectors and the S/C
7. PSF estimations: The photometric observations will be used to estimate the PSF across the field.
8. Timing calibrations: This will be performed using an appropriately chosen pulsar
9. Estimation of background: These will be estimated using the observations collecetd during the PV
phase
Some of these calibrations have been completed and the results are presented below.

several minutes) give FWHM <1.6” (as against the specification of 1.8”).

Shower-like background is seen in ~ 3 frames every second due to interaction of the cosmic-rays. The total
background due to these is ~ 150 events/s

Limits on Brightness for Observations with UVIT
1. Introduction
UVIT uses intensified imagers which can suffer permanent damage if exposed to excessive flux of photons.
Therefore, it is required that observations are only allowed for those fields which have objects below defined
levels of brightness in the field and its close neighbourhood. While a detected photon rate of 5000/s can be
considered as a safe upper-limit for any point source is the field of the detectors, there is another
considerations in defining a practical limit on the rate. The hardware has a provision for safety which initiates
“BOD-trigger” if an excessively bright object (defined by some parameters) is in the field; BOD-trigger initiates
actions which bring all the detectors to OFF condition.
2. Recommended Limits on Count Rates
2.1 The field and its neighbourhood
a) The field of view for UVIT is ~ 28’ in diameter. However, the pointing error can be up to 3’ and there could
be some drift during the exposure. Therefore, for avoidance of bright sources we define the field as 40’
diameter.
b) Scattered light from sources near edges of the field can reach the detector. For a source 30’ away from the
axis, ~ 0.5% of light can reach the detector- most of which would fall in one half of the detector. For sources
at 60’ from the axis, ~ 0.1% of light can reach the detector. Direct tests with the telescopes show that < 0.5%
41
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
of the light reaches the detector for sources at 30’ and 60’ from the centre, and that there are no ghost images
in the field. We take the value of 0.5% for defining limits on the brightness.
2.2 Count Rates in the Field
The following upper limits on count rates are recommended for any point source, or any 100 sq arcsec part of
an extended source, in a field of 40’ diameter around the centre: a) for VIS-CPU: 4800/s (in integration mode
with an intensification ~ 1/20 of that used for photon-counting), b) for NUV-CPU: 1500/s (in Photon Counting
Mode) and c) for FUV-CPU: 1500/s(Photon Counting Mode) .
The above limits are to be followed for most of the observations, but in special cases it may be possible to
allow exposures to brighter sources with a suitable protocol.
2.3 Count rates in neighbourhood of the fields
A total rate of 10^5/s over the full face of the detector can be considered safe in photon-counting mode.
Therefore, a source with count rate < 2 X 10^7/s can be allowed within 60’ (but beyond 20’) of the axis for
observations with NUV and FUV CPUs. For the VIS-CPU, used in integration mode with a lower gain (by a
factor ~10), a count rate of < 10 X (2 X 10^7)/s can be allowed.
Possibility of the ghosts at certain angles cannot be ruled out yet, and in the initial periods of the mission it
would be best to keep the limit to a smaller number, e.g. 10^6/s, and look for possible ghosts.

Soft X-ray Telescope
S
oft X-ray imaging Telescope (SXT) onboard AstroSat is sensitive to soft X-rays in the energy
range of 0.3 − 8 keV. X-rays in this energy range are amenable to focusing and will lead to: a)
nearly 1000 times better sensitivity over non-focusing instruments of similar areas making
over 10,000 sources detectable; b) separation of confusing sources; c) arc min imaging; d)
spatially resolved spectroscopy; and e) variability studies.
SXT covers a very important energy range of the broadband spectrum observed with AstroSat, and
will be able to investigate the following scientific problems.
1. Resolving the K line emission from Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe in hot thermal coronal plasmas, as well as
fluorescent line emission from these elements in the medium photo-ionized by strong X-ray
continuum in accretion powered X-ray sources (neutron stars, stellar mass black-holes,
supermassive black-holes etc.).
2. Carrying out spectroscopy of hot thin plasmas in galaxies, clusters of galaxies, nuclei of active
galaxies, quasars, supernova remnants and stellar coronae.
3. Studying the physics of shocks and accretion disks, coronae, photo-ionized regions and their
density, temperature, ionization degree, and elemental abundance.
4. Studying low energy absorption and the nature of absorbers, for example, whether these are
cold (neutral) or warm (ionized).
5. Studying soft X-ray excesses due to a blackbody emission in AGNs, and in binary X-ray pulsars in
conjunction with other higher energy X-ray instruments.
6. Carrying out Spatially resolved spectroscopy of Supernova Remnants and Clusters of galaxies.
7. Carrying out simultaneous wide-band spectral studies and time-resolved spectra of thermal as
well as non-thermal plasmas in the universe using the unprecedented combination with
sensitive hard X-ray detectors.
Telescope
The telescope consists of a tubular structure housing the assembly of X-ray reflecting mirrors and
other components. There is a “Charge Coupled Device” (CCD) camera at the common focus of all the
mirrors in order to image the cosmic sources.
Basic Components
The basic components of the telescope are given below (see Fig. 3.1).
a) A Mirror Assembly.
b) A Focal Plane Camera Assembly housing a cooled CCD.
43
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
c) A deployable cover/door at the top end of the telescope that covers the optical elements on
the ground and protects them from contamination. This was deployed ~2 weeks after
launch, in a one-time operation, and is perched at an angle of 256°.
d) A “Thermal Baffle” placed between the mirror assembly and the telescope door. All parts are
made of anodized aluminum alloy 6061 T6. The function of the thermal baffle is to protect
the telescope from the Sun, and to provide a base for mounting the heaters to maintain the
optics within a certain specified range of temperatures, and to block the unwanted area of
the optics. The sun avoidance angle with the thermal baffle is ~45o.
e) A “Forward tube” made up of Composite Fiber Reinforcement Plastic (CFRP). The Forward
tube extends from the bottom of the “Top Lid” and it covers the thermal baffle assembly
and 1α section (see below) of the Optics assembly.
f) A metallic ring (Ring 1) provides an interface between the Rear tube 1 andthe middle flange
of the optics from the bottomside. Another ring (Ring 2) provides an interface between the
Forward tube and the Rear tube 1 from the top size.
g) Rear tube-1 made up of CFRP is a hollow cylinder of diameter 343 mm ID and 347.8 mm OD
and extends from Ring-1 to the “Deck Interface Ring” (DIR). It houses 3 (see below) optics
while the Forward tube houses the 1 assembly (see below).
h) “Deck Interface Ring” (DIR) is made up of Al alloy 6061 and is used to assemble rear tube-1
and rear tube-2 of the telescope. DIR has 9 nos. of holes of size M8 to provide interface
between the payload and the top deck of the satellite.
i) Rear tube-2 made up of CFRP is a hollow stepped cylinder with a top portion thicker than the
bottom portion to provide stiffness. Rear tube-2 extends from the DIR to the CCD interface
ring.
j) CCD interface ring is provided to align the CCD Camera with the Rear tube-2 tubular
structure to the desired accuracy. This is made
up of aluminum alloy 6061.

Figure 3.2: The principle of the Wolter I optics using ray diagram. The green lines show the conical
approximations of the paraboloidal and hyperboloidal mirrors.
The Mirror Assembly for X-ray reflection
The mirror assembly of the X-ray telescope in the SXT consists of a set of coaxial and con-focal shells
of conical mirrors approximating paraboloidal and hyperboloidal shapes and arranged behind each
other. This geometrical arrangement is known as Wolter I optics (Fig. 3.2). X-rays are first reflected
by an internally reflecting paraboloidal (1α section) mirror and then reflected to the prime focus of
the telescope by an internally reflecting hyperboloid (3α section) mirror. At grazing incidence, the
active region of the mirror is just a thin annulus giving a small collecting area even for a large
diameter mirror. Thus nesting of Wolter I shells is incorporated to improve the filling factor of the
circle defined by the outermost shell. Higher nesting is achieved by using shells made of very thin
foils but figured in a conical approximation to Wolter I optics. SXT has 40 complete shells of mirrors
assembled quadrants wise (320 mirrors) for 1and 3 mirrors (Fig. 3.1). The focal length of the
telescope is 2000 mm, constrained by the available space in the launch vehicle flaring. Each mirror is
made of aluminum (thickness ~0.2 mm) covered with gold on the reflecting side. The length of each
mirror is 100 mm. The radius of the outermost shell is 130 mm, while that of the innermost shell is
65 mm. The on-axis FWHM and half-power diameter (HPD) of the point spread function (PSF) in the
focal plane is ~2’ and ~10' respectively. The on-axis effective area of the telescope, including CCD
Quantum Efficiency (isolated and bi-pixel events 1-4) and the absorption by the optical blocking filter
as measured, is about 90 cm2 at 1.5 keV (Fig. 3.3).

Focal Plane Camera Assembly
The primary instrument in the Focal Plane Camera Assembly (FPCA; see Fig. 3.4) of the SXT is a
special CCD, which is the focal plane imager. The health and the operational conditions of the CCD
require vacuum, low temperature and protection from the optical light and energetic protons.
Therefore, components such as thermo-electric cooler (TEC), optical blocking filter, proton shield,
etc. have been included in FPCA. The operation of the CCD also requires the processing electronics,
and the calibration of the CCD + processing electronics requires calibration sources.

Focal Plane Camera Assembly Devices and Components
(i) Charge Coupled Device CCD-22:
It is a MOS device built by the e2V Technologies Inc., UK, for the European Photon Imaging Camera
(EPIC) onboard the XMM-Newton observatory and supplied to the University of Leicester and has
the following characteristics (also see Fig 3.5):
(a) A three-phase frame transfer.
(b) Open electrode structure for useful band pass of 0.2 to 10 keV.
(c) Operating area of 610 × 602 array of 40 micron by 40 micron pixels including over-scan.
46
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
(d) The storage region is a 600 × 602 array of 38 x 12 micron pitch.
Figure 3.5: Schematic Diagram of the CCD22.
(ii)Calibration sources:
Four individual 55Fe radioactive calibration sources are provided in the camera for in-flight
calibration at energies of ~5.9keV (Mn). These illuminate the corners of the CCD outside the Field Of
View (FOV). A fifth source under the door facing the CCD is no longer available after the deployment
of the door. See Figure 3.6.
Figure 3.6: The CCD illuminated by 5 internal calibration sources.
47
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
(iii) Optical Blocking Filter:
A thin filter is installed in front of the CCD to block visible light. The filter consists of a single fixed
polyimide film 1840 A° thick coated with 488 Angstroms of Aluminum on one side. The typical
optical transmission of the filter is less than 5 × 10-3 (similar to the XMM-Newton thin filter).The filter
design provides ~ 7 magnitude of optical extinction over the visible band. For the SWIFT SXT with a
PSF of ~15" a 6th magnitude star gives an optical loading of ~ few e- per pixel, at which point the
quality of the X-ray data begins to be affected. For the SXT with a ~7-8 times larger PSF and a 2 times
larger (angular) pixel the safe optical limit should be closer to a ~4 magnitude star. This limit can be
set more accurately in orbit using a bright non-X-ray emitting star. The X-ray transmission of the
filter is shown in Fig. 3.7.
Figure 3.7: The transmission of X-rays through the optical blocking filter.
(iii) Operating Temperature of the CCD:
The X-ray CCD detector is cooled to 191οK (-82o C) by a thermo-electric cooler (TEC) and a radiator
assembly during its operation for low dark current and to reduce sensitivity to radiation damage.
The TEC is coupled to a cold finger connected to a “Heat Pipe” unit which is connected to a radiator
plate designed by ISRO for effective heat dissipation and which provides a maximum temperature of
−40°C at the junction between the heat pipe and the camera cryostat.
(iv) Proton Shield:
The camera is provided with a proton shield to minimize any damage to the device due to energetic
protons. The degradation of energy resolution is, therefore expected to be contained during the 5
years lifetime of the ASTROSAT mission. Due to the orbit of the ASTROSAT being more benign than
the orbit of SWIFT, the mass and size of the proton shield was significantly reduced from the original
SWIFT design.
(vi) Readout Nodes:
Provision has been made for readout from either left node or the right node using node with two
individual pre-amplifiers.

CCD Quantum Efficiency (QE) Curves
The flight device has been calibrated across the energy range giving the measured QE values for iso
events, for events up to 4 pixels in size, and for “all” events, i.e. including those with 5 or more active
pixels. The results of these calibration tests are shown in Fig. 3.8.

Charge Transfer Inefficiency (CTI) and Pile-up effects
The Charge Transfer Inefficiency (CTI) has been measured along both the serial and parallel readouts
using the four corner sources. The serial and parallel CTIs thus measured are shown as a function of
energy in Fig. 3.9.
49
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
Figure 3.9: The serial and parallel CTI as functions of energy.
The CCD camera door is always open and remains open during the data readout. Therefore, if the
source is too strong or the PSF is too sharp then multiple photons can fall on the same pixel during
the 2.4 s that it takes to readout the CCD, leading to a pile-up and affecting spectra, light curves and
images. The amount of pile-up depends on the PSF of the telescope and will need to be corrected for
when the source count rate at the maximum of the PSF becomes ~0.5 cts/pixel/frame. The
measurements of the PSF suggest that it will not become an issue in the PC mode for sources fainter
than ~50 mCrab. For Chandra, XMM-Newton and Swift in imaging modes pile-up occurs for sources
of intensity ~0.1, 1 and 5 mCrab respectively. The pile-up effect depends on the sharpness of the PSF
and the intensity of the source. The exact measurement of this effect is complicated due to
corrections for the attitude variations that are still being implemented, and it will be provided soon.
At present, if a source is producing (or expected to produce) <30 counts/s, it is safe to assume no
pile-up for the PC mode. This limiting count rate will be ~8.6 times larger in the FW mode.

Data Modes and Telemetry
Data from the SXT CCD are stored on-board, and then sent to the ground station once in each orbit
around the Earth. The SXT on-board memory quota is 280 Megabytes per orbit (~ 98 minutes). This
puts serious constraints on the data modes and how the data are packaged. There are four data
modes and one separate mode for only housekeeping. In each mode, data are packed in 2 Kbyte (2K)
segments. So the SXT memory per orbit is filled with approximately 143360 2K blocks.
The various data modes are "Photon Counting" (PC) mode, "Fast Windowed Photon Counting" (FW)
mode, "Bias Map" (BM) mode and "Calibration" (Cal) mode (CM), and there is "House Keeping" (HK)
mode for health parameters of the electronics system. In the PC mode, data from the entire CCD
(i.e., 600 X 600 pixels) are collected, provided these are above a specified threshold energy (set
through a tele-command by the SXT team and it can be between 100 - 200 eV). Currently the
default value set is 105 eV that is 4 above the noise peak. It is, however, recommended that low
energy threshold to be used during analysis should be >=200 eV. Moreover, data from a maximum of
36000 pixels only can be transmitted in this mode. The read-out time of this mode is ~2.4 s. In the
FW mode, a 150 X 150 pixel window is used in the center of the CCD. The read-out time of this mode
is ~278 ms. Data in the FW mode are also thresholded as in the PC mode. The Cal and bias modes
are used to check the calibration of SXT and the zero point for the noise level. The read-out time of
the Cal mode is ~2.4 s. Data from 4 corner windows of the CCD with a size of 80x80 pixels (under 4 X-
ray radioactive sources) and a central window with a size of 100x100 pixels are transmitted with zero
threshold in the CM. BM mode is a separate mode in which the entire CCD frame is sent with zero
threshold. Incrementally addressed 60 rows per CCD frame along with their co-ordinates are sent in
this mode. On the ground, these rows of each incrementally addressed CCD frame are mapped to
generate an individual CCD frame. It takes 24 seconds of data to generate one completely mapped
CCD frame. The HK mode is operated only when there is a failure of both LBT telemetry channels
(main and redundant). When HK mode data command is uploaded, LBT data information in the form
of HK data are sent in 2K data package. Hence only one frame will be generated and pushed in
currently operating mode data package. Spectral information is available under all 4 modes: PC, FW,
CM and BM.
Data (Level 1) in each mode are packaged in 2K blocks. However, the content of a 2K block is not the
same for all the modes. For the PC and FW modes (i.e., the science data), only the channel number
above the pre-selected threshold is stored in the 2K block along with the pixel coordinate and the
CCD frame identification. These data are stored in the 15th to 2042nd bytes of the total of 2048
bytes of a 2K block. Three bytes are required to store each of (a) CCD frame identification, (b) CCD
row number of the pixel and threshold value and (c) CCD column number of the pixel and the
channel number. The bytes 1-14 (header) and 2043-2048 (footer) store the 2K block number, mode
information, on-board time, window location and numbers to check the validity of the 2K block.
Operation Procedure
Normal operations began after the SXT door was opened. The CCD is currently maintaining its
operational temperature with an accuracy of ±2 degs. SXT is pointed towards a celestial source only
after all the observational constraints are met, and the FPCA is normally operated in the PC mode
with full CCD readout unless specified otherwise. The calibration data from the four corner point
sources are part of the observations but unlike in the CM these have a threshold already applied.
Thus normal data have full energy resolution and time resolution of 2.4 sec.

On-board Electronics
The SXT electronics box consists of ten cards of circuits (EL-01 to -08, EL-3A, Motherboard), including
three Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The science data and the bias map data from the
CCD are passed on to the EL-03, where the analog to digital conversion happens. The science data
are then stored in a memory (M1) in EL-05 via the 1st FPGA (EL-04). This memory has two portions:
upper and lower. When the 1st FPGA stores the data in the upper memory, the 2nd FPGA (EL-06)
takes the previous set of data from the lower portion of memory M1. Next time, when the 1st FPGA
stores in the lower portion of memory M1, the 2nd FPGA takes from the upper portion of memory
M1. This way data are continuously passed on from the 1st FPGA to the 2nd FPGA. For bias map
generation, separate dedicated mode can be enabled which sends the entire CCD frame in ~24
seconds. In the 2nd FPGA, the data are packaged in 2 Kbyte blocks (as mentioned in the previous
section), and passed on to the 3rd FPGA (EL-07). Here the data are sent to the satellite memory
(allocated for SXT) via high bit rate telemetry (HBT; rate is 4 MHz). The housekeeping (HK) data from
the FPCA are passed on to the 3rd FPGA via EL-3A, and eventually sent to the satellite memory via
low bit rate telemetry (LBT; rate is 40 kHz). The power from the satellite interface is supplied to
various cards via the relay card (EL-02) and the DC-DC tray (EL-01). The input of the DC-DC tray is
between 28 V and 42 V, and its output to each card is a regulated voltage. The tele-commands from
the satellite interface are passed on to the various cards, and eventually to the FPCA via EL-3A and
EL-02.
Observational Constraints
There are several pointing constraints on the SXT observations, primarily to protect the CCD, the
optical blocking filter above the CCD, and the mirror coating. The most important one is the Sun
avoidance angle (> 45 degree) and is absolutely essential for the safety of the SXT. The other
constraints that can affect the data quality are the Earth limb / bright Earth avoidance angle, the
RAM direction avoidance angle and the Moon avoidance angle. The RAM avoidance of >12 degree is
applied by the mission operations for all the observations as it can also affect the mirrors. The bright
Earth avoidance angle of >110 degree is used in the SXT pipeline while converting level1 data to level
2 data products. The Moon avoidance angle is not being used at the moment.
In-flight Performance
The first six months of observations with AstroSat were dedicated for performance verification (PV)
observations, followed by a six-month long guaranteed time (GT) observation phase. In a typical
orbit, parts of the SXT data are not usable due to SAA passage, eclipse of the source by the Earth and
by the bright Earth viewing that floods the available memory allocation. The net observing efficiency
of the SXT varies from source to source but on the average it is about 25%.
The SXT has observed several X-ray sources like PKS 2155-304, Tycho SNR, 1E 0102-72.3 - an SNR, AB
Dor - an active sun-like star, A1795 - a cluster of galaxies, and several AGN, X-ray binaries, etc. An
example of Tycho spectrum is given in Fig. 3.10. A comparison of the 1E 0102-72.3 spectrum with
the IACHEC model is also shown in Fig. 3.11. SXT was pointed such that 1E 0102.2-7219 and PKS
2155-304 were incident on different parts of the CCD to determine the bore-sight of the telescope
and the vignetting in the SXT at different off-axis angles. Since PKS 2155-304 is variable, we have
mostly relied on the use of the supernova remnant 1E 0102.2-7219 in the Small Magellanic cloud
which, however, required long observations, as the source is very weak in the SXT. This source emits
mostly soft X-rays and is seen in 0.3 - 3 keV energy band. The results from these observations
showed that the bore sight of the SXT is close to center of the foV at the CCD detector
52
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
coordinatesX=302±7 and Y=285±7 in pixels. The vignetting of the telescope or the projected area as
a function of off-axis angle was also determined.
Figure 3.10: The SXT sprectrum of Tycho.
Figure 3.11: The X-ray spectrum of 1E0102-72.3 as fitted with the IACHEC model derived from several X-ray
observatories carrying a CCD camera in the focal plane of a telescope. The SXT spectrum was extracted from a
radius of 10 arcmin.
The on-axis point spread function (PSF) in the focal plane is well characterized by a double King
function (see Fig. 3.12). The two King functions have core radii of 54±8 and 680 (-200, +400) arcsec
respectively with the broader King function having ~8% of the intensity compared to the narrower
King function. The broader King model is indicative of the misalignment and the scattering in
53
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
themirrors. The half light (intensity) radius is ~70 arcsec, the half encircled energy radius is ~6
arcmin. Care must be taken while carrying out the spectral radius to include as much of the encircled
energy as possible while extracting a spectrum, and then use the corresponding response for the
telescope area function from those provided. For very bright sources, the user may have to include a
radius as large as 18 arcmins to get all the photons and then use background from a deep field with
no detectable objects.

sec), whereas, Y-axis gives the normalized counts. The best-fit double King function model, as well as the two
King function components, are shown.

Data Analysis Tools
The raw data obtained from the ASTROSAT are processed and made available in required format for
use. The data analysis software has been developed for the purpose of processing data at different
data Levels as described below.
54
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
Level-0 data: The Level-0 data are considered as instrument-wise raw data in binary format along
with its associated auxiliary data, which are segregated from all instrument combined raw-data
obtained through telemetry. These data are very mission specific and hence are not available for
public use.
Level-1 data: These data are obtained by applying various transformations on Level-0 data and are
stored in the FITS format. The data will be available for public use after some initial lock-in period.
The PI of the proposal will be given access to the data at the earliest possible time after a pre-
processing to level-2 and a check out by the SXT-POC. Level-1 data directory would contain science
data file, time calibration file, attitude file, orbit-file, level-1 MKF file and house-keeping data file.
Level-2 data: These data contain standard science products obtained from processing of Level-1 data
for a default set of parameters and would be available for public use. The level-2 software offers
user interface for proper selection of parameters and desired analysis of Level-1 data. One can have
selections of these parameters depending on science objectives.
The Level-1 to Level-2 data processing software:
Pipeline data analysis software requires Level-1 data files and calibration data files from SXT
Calibration database, CALDB as input for its execution. The data processing steps involve, event
extraction using SXTEVTGEN, time tagging of events using SXTTIMETAG, coordinate transformation
from raw to detector and XY co-ordinates using SXTCOORD, bias subtraction and adjustment using
SXTBIASSUB and SXTBIASADJ, flagging of bad pixels and calibration source events using SXTFLAGPIX,
events grading and PHA construction for each event using SXTEVTGRADE, search for hot and flicker
pixels using SXTHOTPIX and then carrying out PHA to PI conversion of events using SXTCALCIPI. The
data processing thus generates an unfiltered event file. The tool SXTFILTER is used to create Level-2
MKF file. To generate cleaned event file, data screening is done using tool SXTSCREEN on unfiltered
event file utilizing Level-2 MKF file, HK and event range files from calibration database. Basic Level_2
data products such as image, light curve and spectrum are generated utilizing clean event file by
product generation tool, SXTPRODUCTS designed based on XSELECT interface from HEASARC (NASA).
The Level-2 data products so generated using pipeline processing are further processed and
corrected for proper exposures. The target source centroid position would be determined with
associated errors using SXTCENTRIOD. The SXTMKARF could generate corrected ARF that would
account for vignetting, psf and exposure correction based on exposure map. However, standard on-
axis ARF files for various extraction radii are provided at this time, and users should use these. The
exposure map is generated using SXTEXPOMAP, which accounts for the loss of flux due to marked
bad pixels and columns. The XSPEC tool would then be used with ARF, detector RMF along with the
spectral data to generate intrinsic source spectrum. The light curve and image would also be
corrected for exposure utilizing exposure map. Higher-level data files would be compatible for use
with standard astronomical tools such as XRONOS, XIMAGE, XSPEC and FTOOLS etc.
All the SXT tools mentioned above have been configured appropriately with proper interfaces so
that complete data processing is done in a single chain by a single command up to Level-2 data
product generation. However, individual tools can also be run on the data.
Instructions for analysing SXT Level-2 data in order to extract science can be found at
http://astrosat-ssc.iucaa.in/uploads/sxt/Analysing_SXT.txt . The required response matrices can be

Writing an SXT Proposal
The details of proposal preparation and required resources can be found at http://astrosat-
ssc.iucaa.in/?q=proposal_preparation . Note that there is an offset between the SXT pointing and
the pointings of LAXPC, CZTI and UVIT. These offsets are of the order of a few arcminutes. Therefore,
the proposers should use the PC mode when SXT is not the primary instrument. This is because, the
source may be out of the SXT FoV for the FW mode in this case. However, one may need to use the
SXT FW mode for some science goals in order to reduce pile-up and/or to have better time
resolution. In such a case, proposers should make SXT the primary instrument, even if SXT does not
serve the primary science.

Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter
L
arge Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) is one of the major payloads on ASTROSAT, which
2
covers energy range of 3 – 100 keV and with its large area of collection, about 6000 cm , it is well suited
for timing and spectral measurements. The large detection volume (15 cm depth) of LAXPCs and being
filled with xenon gas at 2 atmospheres pressure, results in detection efficiency greater than 50%, in 30-
80 keV band. These three LAXPC units on ASTROSAT will thus have the largest effective area and
sensitivity among all the satellite missions flown so far for X-ray astronomy studies in 20-100 keV energy
range.
The principal scientific objectives of LAXPC are as follows:
 Detailed studies of stellar-mass black holes with masses ~ 3-10 M in our Galaxy and the

neighbouring galaxies and massive black holes (~10 to 10 M) in AGNs will be realized with the
6 9 
LAXPC instrument. This will be achieved by measuring variations in the luminosity of sources and
the time scales of variations.
 Studies of periodic (pulsations, binary light curves, QPOs etc.) and aperiodic (flaring activity,
bursts, flickering and other chaotic variations) variability in X-ray pulsars and other X-ray
binaries, coronal X-ray sources, Cataclysmic Variables (CVs), Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and
other galaxies etc. by high time resolution (~10μsec) photometry over a wide spectral band
covering 3-100 keV with a single instrument. Rapid variability studies e.g. sub-second variations,
high and low frequency QPOs and kHz QPOs in soft and hard x-ray bands, probe astrophysical
processes closest to the central source.
 Low to moderate spectral resolution studies of continuum X-ray emission over a broad band of
3-100 keV for X-ray binaries, Supernova remnants (SNRs), CVs, Stellar Coronae, AGNs etc. This
will be done using large area and low to moderate energy resolution ( Δ E / E ~ 10 to 20 %) of
LAXPCs.
 Correlated time variations of intensity in 3-100 keV band with those in the visible, UV and soft X-
ray (0.3-8 keV) bands to investigate the origin and mechanism of emission of radiation in
different wave bands.
 Discovery of non-thermal components in the X-ray spectra of SNRs and Clusters of Galaxies by
accurate spectral measurements in 3-100 keV band combined with simultaneous measurements
57
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
from SXT in 0.3-8 keV region to estimate their magnetic field strength as well as to understand
the acceleration processes and origin of cosmic rays in the case of SNRs.
 Measuring magnetic fields of neutron stars by detection and studies of cyclotron lines, most of
which lie in 15-60 keV regions in the X-ray spectra of x-ray pulsars.
 Search for X-ray transient sources will be conducted by repeated surveys in the limited regions
of the galactic plane with the LAXPC
Payload configuration:
The LAXPC instrument sensitive in 3-100 keV band, consists of 3 identical units, each with its own
independent front-end electronics, HV supply, and signal processing electronics to facilitate easy
replacement of the entire LAXPC unit in case any problem is encountered before the launch. The Time
mark generating electronic unit is common for all the 3 LAXPCs. The data from all the 3 LAXPCs are
independently acquired preserving the identity of each unit. These data are merged in a single telemetry
data stream from which data for each LAXPC is recovered.

Details of detector system:
Each LAXPC detector consists of 60 anode cells of 3 cm x 3 cm cross-section and length of 100 cm,
arranged in 5 layers providing a 15 cm deep X-ray detection volume. Each Anode Layer thus has 12
anodes with a total width of 36 cm. A Veto Layer made up of 46 anode cells each with cross-section of
1.5 cm X 1.5 cm surrounds the main X-ray detection volume on 3 sides to reject events due to charged
particles and interaction of high energy photons in the detector. The alternate anode cells of Layer 1 and
60
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
2 are linked together and thus 4 outputs are obtained from Layer 1 and Layer 2. The anode cells in each
of the Layer 3, 4 and 5 are linked together to provide one output from each layer. Thus, there are 7
anode outputs that are operated in mutual anticoincidence to reduce the non-cosmic X-ray background
The Veto layer is divided in 3 parts providing 3 Veto Layer outputs. The left side and right side veto
anodes are linked together to provide one output from each one and the third veto output is from the
bottom layer veto anodes linked together. The configuration of anodes is shown in the figure.
To suppress background from charged particles all events, which register in multiple anodes, or those,
which trigger the veto anodes are rejected, except for the situation where one of the energies is in the K
X-rays for Xenon. For X-rays with energy above the K-edge of Xe, a K-electron may be ejected and the
ion can radiate a K X-ray photon in energy range 29.4 - 34.4 keV. These X-ray may escape from the
detector or be absorbed in a different anode. In order to include such events the anticoincidence logic is
modified to detect this energy range. If two main anodes register an event and at least, one of them is in
the energy range, of 25-35 keV, then the energy of the two anodes are added and the event is accepted.
The lower threshold for this (KLLD) and the upper threshold (KULD) can be set through tele-command.
A 50 micron thick aluminized Mylar film serves as the gas barrier as well as the X-ray entrance window
for the detector. The detector is filled with a mixture of 90 % Xenon + 10 % Methane at a pressure of
1520 torr. LAXPC30 has a slightly different gas-mixture as compared to other two detector units (84.4%
Xenon, 9.4% Methane and 6.2% Argon). The Mylar window is supported against the gas pressure by a
honeycomb shaped collimator made of square geometry aluminium cells termed as Window Support
Collimator (WSC). The Field Of View Collimator (FOVC) is placed above the WSC and is aligned with the
openings in the WSC. The FOVC is made of sheets of tin, copper and aluminium and is placed in a
61
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
collimator housing. The total height of the collimators is about 45 cm giving a Field of View (FOV) of
about 0.9 degree X 0.9 degree. A one mm thick tin sheet coated with copper serves as the shield for X-
rays entering the detector from the sidewalls.
Processing electronics and Timing capability:
There are 7 anode outputs from the X-ray detecting cells and 3 veto outputs from each detector that are
fed to 10 charge sensitive preamplifiers (CSPAs). High voltage to the anodes is supplied from a command
controlled HV unit whose HV output can be varied by command. The 7 X-ray anode and 3 Veto layer
outputs from the CSPAs are sent to the peak detectors and events satisfying the selection logic as true X-
ray events are further processed by signal processing electronics for
(a) Broad Band (BB) counting
(b) for time tagging of every event with its energy to an accuracy of 10 micro-sec.
Details of Broad Band Counting:
For the purpose of BB counting the Bin time can be selected, in multiple of 2, from 16 msec to 2048
msec, 128 msec being the default value. The Bin times for the BB counting is selectable by command.
For BB counting output Anode 1 & 2 are combined as layer-L1, similarly Anode 3 & 4 are combined as
layer – L2 and Anode 5, 6 & 7 are combined as layer – L3. All Anti anode A8, A9 & a10 are combined as
Anti counter. All the events in each LAXPC above a lower energy threshold of 3 keV in main anodes (A1
to A7) (LLD), upper energy threshold of 80 keV in main anodes (A1 to A7) (ULD), all the three Veto layer
counts termed as Anti counts and several other count rates detailed below, are also recorded in
separate counters.
62
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
63
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
Various counters in BBC frames are as follow:
64
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
Modes of operation of LAXPC:
The LAXPC payload consists of three independent LAXPC units with identical operational modes. There
are three different modes of operation and each instrument can be operated simultaneously
in more than one mode.
The LAXPC data carries information about cosmic X-rays detected with the instruments and it has
three entries:
(a) time of detection
(b) energy (spectral channel) of the X-ray photons and
(c) identity of the detecting element (detector/anode-layer) including double-identity in some
cases.
The signals generated by the instrument after detection of X-rays are processed and stored in any of
the following modes.
 Normal (or Default) Modes of Operation:
In Normal operation, there are two modes running simultaneously and data are acquired
from each LAXPC.
(a) Broad Band Counting Data: Records the rate of occurrence of events in various energy bands
with selectable time Bin (16 msec to 2048 msec). Default value is 128 msec. Details of the count
rate capabilities of the various counters are given in the table. There are 15 counters for the
broad band counting of the valid X-ray events in different energy bands covering 3-100 keV from
3 layers as discussed earlier.
(b) Event Mode Data: in this mode, arrival time of each event is time tagged to an accuracy of 10
microseconds. Simultaneously the energy and identity of each event is also recorded. This mode
generates 5 bytes data for each accepted and analysed event. In this mode, the dead time of the
detector is around 54 microseconds.
 Fast Counter Mode:
In this mode, the event rate is measured only from the top layer of each LAXPC detector in 4 energy
channels covering 3-20 keV band with a fixed time bin of 160 microsecond. In this mode, dead time
is about 10 microsecond. Each of 4 counters are 8 bit deep and cover 3-6,6-8 , 8-12 and 12-20 keV
energy bands. This mode is to be used for studying rapid variability during the short duration flares
or outbursts of sources.
Data from different modes of observation will be treated separately. The extraction criteria will be user
defined and will require input from the housekeeping parameters. The auxiliary data will have to be
processed separately. Certain housekeeping information will be derived independently from detector
raw data.
Detection Efficiency and Effective Area:
Detection efficiency is determined by the thickness of entrance window at the low energy end and by
the probability of photoelectric interaction in the detector gas volume at the higher energy end. GEANT4
simulations of detector have been used to estimate the effective area and field of view. The simulations
65
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
were validated by comparing the simulations with observations using radioactive sources. The field of
view (FWHM) is found to be 43’ at 15 keV, 47’ at 50 keV and 52’ at 80 keV. The increase in field of view
with energy is due to some part of the collimator becoming nearly transparent to high energy X-rays.
The effective area calculated through simulations is reduced by 7% to account for imperfections in
collimator as estimated by calibration using radioactive sources. A plot of effective area of the detector
as a function of energy of X-rays is shown in figure, which also shows the same for RXTE.
Effective area of LAXPC and RXTE. The LAXPC effective area first derived in lab from simulation and
finally corrected with Crab observations in the orbit
(Antia et al (2017) http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08624)
Dead Time Measurement of LAXPC Detector:
The test has been carried out using commercial mini X-ray gun (MINI X) mounted on specially designed
X-Y source motion jig. The jig allows movement of the X-ray gun in controlled speed along both X and Y
axis over the complete area of LAXPC detector. To avoid overexposure at one spot on detector, the X-ray
gun is kept moving at slow speed along the length of cell. A commercial MCA is used to record the
spectrum and counts for different event rates. The MCA provides dead time corrected incident event
66
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
rate. The same setting of X-ray gun and jig is then used and event data are acquired with LAXPC PE and
STBG unit. The counts as measured by MCA, is used as actual input counts and using the measured
counts, the dead time is calculated as shown in figure. This measurement confirms with the number
arrived at from analysis of processing time in electronics and the timing diagrams for the same.
Dead time of LAXPC detector observed during initial development of the LAXPC instrument in the lab
High frequency re-binned Power Density Spectrum (PDS) of GRS 1915+105 in the SPL class observed
during 5-7 March 2016 which estimates dead time of 42.3 microsecond (Yadav et al. (2016) ApJ, 833,
p27). See text for detail
Dead time was further reduced to ~ 43 microsecond by optimising reading and writing sequences.
During the performance verification phase, Astrosat observed the black hole system GRS 1915+105
during 5-7 March 2016. To test the timing characteristics of the detector, event mode data is used to
calculate the power density spectrum (PDS) up to the Nyquist frequency of 50 kHz which is shown in
above figure. The resulting PDS does not show any instrumental effect other than peaks beyond 10 kHz
due to thedead time of the detector (which gives dead time ~42.3 microsec). The green line in the figure
shows the expected peak power of a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with quality factor Q=4 and rms of
5%. This implies that LAXPC instrument can detect QPOs of such a strength easily till 3000 Hz.

ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
Instrument Calibration:
Ground calibration:
To obtain the energy response of detectors, 3 radioactive sources at different energies in the range of
LAXPC detector were used. The calibration was repeated at 3 temperatures of 10°C, 20°C and 30°C to
study the temperature dependence of detector response. The following 3 sources were used:
1. Fe 55 with energy 5.9 keV. These X-rays are absorbed in the top layer and hence only the two
top anodes A1, A2 register these events.
2. Cd with energies, 22.1 keV (54.5%), 21.9 keV (28.8%), 24.9 keV (13.7%), 88.0 keV
109
(3.0%).
The detector cannot resolve the first two peaks, while the third one gives a small feature at the
high end of the main peak, which can be fitted with some effort. The last peak is beyond the
range of the detector, but it can give a small contribution when the Xe-K X-ray escapes the
detector. However, the resulting peak is too weak to be detected.
3. Am 241 with energy 59.6 keV. This source also gives additional peaks because of loss of energy
due to Xe-K X-rays escaping the detector. The detector logic is built to add contributions in 2
channels, if one of them is in the range of Xe-K (25 –35 keV). Hence, the 59.6 keV peak consists
of 2 parts, one where the entire energy is absorbed in the same anode and second where the
Xe-K X-ray is absorbed in a different anode and the two contributions are added to one of the
anode. If only one anode is in the Xe-K range the energy deposited in that anode is added to the
other anode where remaining energy is deposited. If the energy deposited in both anodes is in
the Xe-K range then the lower of the two energies is added to the anode, which has higher
energy. The Xe Kα X-rays have energies of 29.8 keV and 29.5 keV, which account for about 81%
of Xe-K X-rays, while the remaining fraction comes as Xe K-beta with energies 33.6–34.4 keV.
Thus in addition to the 59.6 keV peak we also get two peaks when Xe-K X-rays escape from the
detector giving the energies of about 30 keV and 26 keV. Because of limited resolution of the
detector, the last two peaks are not well separated.
In order to estimate detector background, the counts are recorded without any source, before and after
the source measurements are done. The background counts over a time interval equal to that for source
are then subtracted from counts with source to get the net contribution from the source. All these
measurements were done inside the thermovac.
In order to perform the calibration inside the thermovac chamber, an x–y motion platform for
movement of radioactive sources above the Field of View (FOV) Collimator was designed. This can hold
all three sources and expose one or more of them at a time. The x–y motion platform can function in
vacuum and its movements and source on/off status can be controlled remotely. The movement of
sources is controlled by a program to move the source at predetermined rates in x or y direction. To
cover the entire area of the detector the source was moved along the y direction that moves it across
the 12 cells followed by a movement along X axis. The sequence is repeated until the entire range is
covered. Figure below shows the route traced by the source. To determine the characteristics of
individual cells some scans were also done along each of the 12 cells, where the movement was
restricted to x direction only along the wire.

X-Y source motion on LAXPC Detector for the calibration in vacuum chamber
X-axis (across the anode wire) calibration pattern.
Energy Resolution as a function of energy:
The energy resolution and channel to energy mapping were calibrated using three radioactive sources,
Fe (5.9 keV), Cd (22 keV/ 24.9 keV) and Am (59.6 keV). In order to perform the calibration inside a
55 109 241
thermovac chamber, an x-y motion platform for movement of radioactivesources above the FOVC was
designed. This can hold all these sources and expose one or more ofthem at a time. The movement is
controlled remotely and can be programmed. The movement of source across the detector also allows
us to estimate the transmission efficiency of collimator due to possible imperfections in the collimator
fabrication. The calibration was repeated at temperatures of 10 C, 20 C and 30 C to study the
temperature dependence of energy resolution and peak position.
The spectra of the three sources and background obtained from observations at 10 C and the energy
resolution and the peak channel for the 4 main peaks in the spectra are shown in the following figure.

To validate the GEANT4 simulation the events for each radioactive source were simulated. The total
energy deposited in each anode was calculated for each event. In order to simulate the effect of finite
energy resolution a random number with normal distribution is added to the energy in each cell. The
random number is selected to have a zero mean and a standard deviation of σ. Here the relative
standard deviation σ are treated as free parameters, which are chosen to get the best fit to observed
spectra. For each peak in the spectrum we use a different σ. This gives 4 parameters, one each for Fe55
and Cd109 peaks and two for Am241 spectrum. Although, some of these peaks have multiple energies
which are not resolved, we use the same σ for the entire peak. The total energy, E, in each anode is
translated to channel number, n , using
c
n = e + e E(1+e E)
c 0 1 2
Here e gives a small nonlinear contribution, which is required to fit all spectra. Because of this
2
nonlinearity the peak in Am241 spectrum around 60 keV is split into two parts, one due to events where
entire energy is deposited in one anode, and second where the energy is split between two anodes and
is then added, as one of the energy is the Xe K rays range. This gives rise to an asymmetry in this peak.
The energy resolution of the two peaks is also different. The effective resolution of this peak quoted in
the table above is in between that for the two peaks. The fitted resolutions for the four peaks are shown
in figure, which also gives a linear spline interpolation for σ^2.

At 20 C, the channel number is given by e =-3.3, e =9.16 keV-1, e =0.0018 keV-1. These fitted parameters

are used to generate the response matrix for the detector.
Power spectra obtained from event mode data at different count rates
The timing characteristics of LAXPC event mode data is as expected (featureless) at frequencies below
390 Hz corresponding to bin size of 2.56 ms. The power density spectra obtained from light curves at
different rates up to 12500 c/s are shown in above figure. At higher count rate, the spectra shows lesser
power, which is expected due to the dead time of the LAXPC processing electronics.
Expected background in different energy bands:
Background spectra in the laboratory is shown in figure below. To estimate the background in orbit we
did GEANT4 simulations for photons and charge particles with various energies. These simulations
included the collimator as well as shield surrounding the detector. It appears that major contribution
may be due to diffuse X-ray background. For this purpose, we assumed a background flux of 87.4 E-2.3
cm-2 s-1 keV-1 steradian-1. The estimated background combining all 3 LAXPC detectors is shown in the
figure. The actual background in orbit can only be measured after launch of ASTROSAT.
72
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
The total background is expected to be about 500 s-1. In the low energy band of 3-20 keV the background
is about 80 s-1
Above Figure shows the observed background in orbit 837-842 (black), earth occultation background
and simulation X-ray background (for LAXPC30 only) from diffused X-ray flux (local satellite

Time exposure for sources of different intensity:
Using the response matrix generated it is possible to simulate the response of detector at different
energy spectra. The figure shows the response for different mono-energetic sources.
The simulated spectra for the Crab source with 100 s observation is shown in the figure. This gives a
count rate of about 5000 s-1
Simulated spectrum for Crab X-ray source
For a 1 mCrab source observation over 100 s can detect it at 3σ level in 3-100 keV. If the energy range is
restricted to 3-10 keV, the detection improves to 6σ level.

Observation Strategies for LAXPC:
 Time tagged photons for periodic and fast time variability studies
 Spectral features using individual photon energy measurement data
 Fast timing mode data for bright and bursting sources
 Broad Band Counting (BBC) for quick study of time variability
Integration time for the BBC will depend on the source intensity and time scale of variability.
 For studying variability over time scale << 1 sec, use BBC integration time of 16 msec, for a few sec
variability use 64 / 128 msec and for still slower variations use 1.024 sec BBC BIN time.
 For study of fast pulsars (e.g. 33 msec pulsar in Crab Nebula) or millisecond accreting pulsars or
rotation powered pulsars of << 1 sec period use time tagged photon data.
 For very bright sources like Sco X-1, Cyg X-1, Crab Nebula, Bright Transients etc that may give a
count rate of about 10 k per sec or more, use time tagged photon data for variability and spectral
studies.
On-board Purification:
Each of the LAXPC detectors will have an onboard gas purification system. This system will be operated
as and when required to purify the gas filled in the detector by command. Since operating power
required for purification system is large, all the three LAXPC detectors as well as their associated
processing electronics will be powered down before gas purification system is powered on.
75
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
We have taken great care by keeping evacuated all the three detectors with the top cover for most of
the time when detectors are not being tested. During last two months prior to ASTROSAT launch on 28
September 2015, we replaced top cover by nitrogen purging cover designed by ISAC team.
Bagging and Nitrogen purging of LAXPC:
LAXPC flight Spare detector with Nitrogen purging arrangement in ISAC clean room
Each of the LAXPC detectors has an onboard gas purification system. This system will be operated as and
when required to purify the gas filled in the detector when detector resolution deteriorates below
threshold. It is expected that energy resolution of LAXPC detector will degrade as impurity increases.
LAXPC10 detector was last purified in November 2013 (almost two years back) and was likely to
absorb more impurities than the LAXPC30 which was last purified in October 2014 before final
calibration in lab. All the LAXPC detectors were kept without cover many times specially for about 20
days at SHAR prior to the launch. The purification systems were operated during 20-21 October and 24
November 2015 and the results are shown in figure next page. The purification system was operated for
LAXPC10, LAXPC20 and LAXPC30 detectors. The energy resolution of LAXPC10 detector improved after
purification from 21% to 11% at 30 keV and from 16% to 9% at 60 keV. All the three LAXPC detectors
have energy resolution 10-12% in the energy range 22-60 keV. We also observed CAS-A supernova
remnant on 25 November 2015 to study energy resolution at lower energy, which shows ~20% energy
resolution at 6.4 keV.

Calibration in orbit:
To determine the field of view of collimator we performed scan across the Crab X-ray source to find a
FWHM value of about 0.9 degree. The scan was also used to estimate the offset in pointing between the
Satellite axis and each of the 3 LAXPC detectors. The pointing directions for the three detectors are
summarised in the following Table:
Detector R A Dec offset
LAXPC10 83.78 22.01 0.15
LAXPC20 8 3.62 22.08 0.07
LAXPC30 8 3.74 22.03 0.11
Mean 83.71 22.04 0.09
Crab 83.63 22.01
These offsets are expected to reduce the efficiency of detectors by 8-15% as determined from the scan.
The ULD and anti count rate in orbit is about 1000 counts/s, which would also reduce the efficiency by
about 5%.

We observed crab during March 2016 and we have fit its energy spectrum in 3-100 keV energy range for
LAXPC10 detector system with no systematics added. Results are shown in the figure above. This
observation was used to fine-tune the response matrix for all three detectors.
Fit to Crab data of LAXPC/AstroSat and Nustar observed simultaneously on 1st April, 2016 (Antia et al.
2017; http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08624)
To determine the effective area we have carried out simultaneous observations of Crab with NuSTAR in
April 2016 and simultaneous fits with the three LAXPC detector have been used to estimate the
effective area. Simultaneous fit for LAXPC10 and Nustar for Crab data taken on 1st April, 2016 is shown
in the figure above.
The reduced chi square is ~1 for a power law index ~2.102 and normalization ~8.206. The detection
efficiency of Nustar drops fast above 30 keV which is reflected in large spread in data for energy > 30 keV.
We have used these observations to correct effective area of LAXPC instrument.

Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager
T
he Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) is one
among the four X-ray instruments on ASTROSAT.
It is a hard X-ray imaging instrument covering
the energy band from 10 to 100 keV, has a
detector area of 976 cm2 constructed using CZT modules
and uses a Coded Aperture Mask (CAM) for imaging.
The characteristics of the CZT-Imager are given in Table
5.1 (Figure 5.1). The total detection area of 976 cm2 is
achieved by the use of 64 CZT modules of area 15.25 cm2
each. These 64 modules are arranged in four identical
and independent quadrants. The overall dimensions of
the CZTI are shown in Figure 5.2 and the orientation
reference is shown in Figure 5.3. The CZT detector is
interfaced to a radiator platewhich maintains an
operating temperature of 0 to 15deg Celsius by passive
cooling. The instrument is mounted on the satellite deck
with the radiator plate looking in the direction of the
satellite +Yaw axis. Collimators above each detector
module restrict the Field of View to 4.6° x 4.6° (Full
Figure 5.1: The Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI)
Width at Half Maximum) at photon energies below 100
keV. At energies above that the collimator slats and the
coded mask become progressively transparent. For Gamma Ray Bursts, the instrument behaves like an all-sky
open detector.
The CZTI carries a Cesium Iodide (Tl) based scintillator detector operated in anti-coincidence with the main
CZT detector and it is called the Veto detector. This is located just under the CZT detector modules. Further,
there is a gap of about 8 cm between the base of the collimator slats and the detector plane, in order to
accommodate a radioactive calibration source module in each quadrant. This source shines alpha-tagged 60
keV photons on the CZT detector in order to help calibrate the energy response.
The science objectives of the CZTI include the measurement of curvature and reflection components in the
spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei and X-ray binary systems, the study of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations at hard X-
ray bands in accreting neutron star and black hole systems, cyclotron line spectroscopy of high mass X-ray
binaries, the characterization of hard X-ray spectra of magnetars as well as the detection of gamma ray bursts
and the study of their early light curves. Polarization measurement of gamma-ray bursts and bright (> 500
mCrab) sources in 100 – 300 keV region is an additional objective of CZT Imager.

The CZT Imager payload is divided into two packages: CZTI detector box and CZTI Processing Electronics. The
detector box houses the detectors with front end electronics and all mechanical interfaces including CAM, cooling
arrangement etc. The four quadrants are electrically independent and communicate, digitally, only with the
Processing Electronics (PE) box. The PE handles all interfaces (including detector interface) and houses the onboard
software designed for the optimum performance of the payload. The basic details of these two packages are given
in Table 5.2.

Detector Module Details
The CZT-Imager detector box contains Cadmium Zinc Telluride as the main X-ray detector and a CsI (Tl) crystal
is used as a veto detector for background reduction. In addition to these two detectors an alpha-tagged X-ray
source is also used for calibration purposes (Rao et al. 2010, NIMA, 616, 55). The Front-end electronics in the
detector box handles the outputs from these detectors for further analysis while low voltage and high voltage
supplies provide the necessary power and biasing voltages to the detectors. A passive collimator (FOV of 4.6°
X 4.6° FWHM) helps in allowing nearly parallel X-rays to enter the detector. A Coded Aperture Mask (CAM)
made of tantalum is positioned above the collimator.
a. The basic detector module is a CZT crystal of size 39.06 mm X 39.06 mm and 5 mm thick. It is
pixelated by contact points on one side with a pixel size of 2.46 mm X 2.46 mm, except for edge rows
which are 2.31 mm wide. The edge pixels are thus 2.31mm x 2.46 mm in size, and the corner pixels
are of size 2.31 mm X 2.31 mm. One detector module thus becomes an array of 16 X 16 pixels of CZT.
The overall geometric area (976 cm2) of the instrument is achieved by using 64 detector modules
divided into four quadrants, eachquadrant containing a 4 x 4 matrix of detector modules mounted on
the Detector board.
Each individual pixel is connected to a pre-amplifier, which is embedded in an Application Specific
Integrated Circuit (ASIC) containing 128 channels. Two ASICs are situated just behind the detector
wafer. The X-ray detector has a detection efficiency of 95% within 10 - 120keV and good energy
resolution (~ 6 % at 100 keV).The ASIC is a fully data-driven charge signal acquisition chip. It provides
digital output corresponding to the detected X-ray energy and digital address of the incidental pixel.
b. The veto detector is a CsI (Tl) scintillator of size 167 mm X 167 mm and 20 mm thickness viewed by
two one-inch Photo-multiplier tubes (PMT) positioned on two sides of the crystal. Minimum detection
sensitivity is 50 keV for incident photons. The CsI detector requires High Voltage (HV) of the order of
800 V, which is generated by the electronic circuits in the Crystal Holder.
c. Another CsI (Tl) 10 mm cube crystal viewed by a photodiode of 10 mm square area and embedded
with a radioactive source Am241 is placed on top of the CZT detector. At every disintegration of an
Am241 nucleus, a 60 keV photon is generated, accompanied by an alpha particle of energy of about 5
MeV. The alpha particle is absorbed in the small CsI (Tl) detector whereas the 60keV X-rays escape
from this detector and in a very substantial number of cases interact in the CZT detector. The alpha
particle gives a light pulse in the CsI (Tl) crystal which in turn is converted into an electrical pulse at
the output of the photo-diode. Any output in the CZT detector coincident with the pulse output from
the CsI (Tl) detector is deemed to be originating from a 60 keV photon. This method is used to
calibrate the CZT detector for its energy response.
83
Mechanical and Thermal Design
The mechanical parts of the CZTI consist of the following:
CZTImager Housing
The housing is made out of blocksofAluminum alloy to increase the integrity of the payload. It has an overall
dimension of 482 mm x 482 mm and 195 mm height. All peripheral walls (vertical & slant) of the housing are
configured with suitable ribs and minimum wall thickness. The top half of the housing has circumferential as
well as central flanges which are suitably stiffened by providing gussets and stiffeners to withstand load
coming from collimator housing which will be integrated on this.
Crystal Holder
CsI crystal holder is a sub-assembly interfaced with the Detector housing and it accommodates (1) the CsI
crystal (2)aPower Card with HV DC-DC, pre-amplifier and power electronics. The CsI crystal is mounted on top
of the housing and is held by a clamp specially designed for it. The Power card is assembled on the rear side of
crystal housing.
Detector Board Assembly
The Detector Board consists of a PCB to mount the 16 detector modules, Front-end Electronics Board (FEB),
and a specially designed Internal Radiator Plate which acts as an interface between the detector modules and
the heat pipes so that uniform temperature is maintained across all detector modules.
Functions of detector board assembly:
 Holding the CZT detector modules in a specified format.
 Providing interface to the Detector housing.
 Providing interface to the Calibration housing.
 Providing interface to the heat pipes.
Radiator Assembly
The CZT modules perform best in a temperature range of 0° C to 15° C. To achieve this temperature, the heat
produced by CZT module (300 mW/module) is drained continuously by the radiator assembly, which consists
of (i) Heat pipes (3 nos.) (ii) Radiator plate and (iii) Spacers & clamps. The radiator plate area required to
radiate the total power of 50 W is about 7000 cm2.
Collimator
The Collimator plates are made of 0.07 mm thick Tantalum sheet sandwiched between 0.2 mm thick precisely
machined Aluminum alloy plates, providing a collimation of 4.6° X 4.6° FWHM directly under the collimator.
However since a gap of 100 mm is left between the bottom of the collimator and the detector plane to
accommodate the calibration housing, a certain amount of illumination leakage occurs from one collimated
module to its adjacent neighbors. When this illumination overlap is taken into account, the net field of view
works out to be 11.8° x 11.8° FWZM.
84
Collimator housing
The Collimator housing is a hollow structure, configured quadrant wise, with a single quadrant 167.5 mm x
167.5 mm x 400 mm, made up of four aluminum alloy side plates, which are integrated side-by-side using M4
fasteners.
The Coded Aperture Mask
The design of the CAM for the CZTI is such that the size of the mask plate is the same as that of the detector
itself. The mask is made of a 0.5 mm thick Tantalum plate in which a pre-determined pattern of holes is cut to
allow X-rays to pass through. The Coded Mask forms the topmost part of CZTI payload. It is coded by open
and closed pattern of squares/rectangles matching the size of the detector pixels. Additional support bridges
of thickness 0.2mm are introduced at a number of places within the pattern to improve its mechanical
stability. In such a design (called a ‘box-type’ or ‘simple’ system) exposure to the full mask pattern is not
possible anywhere except exactly at the middle of the coded field of view. At all other angles only a part of
the shadow of the mask falls on the detector. The patterns are based on 255-element pseudo-noise
Hadamard Set Uniformly Redundant Arrays. Of sixteen possible such patterns, seven were chosen on the
basis of the mechanical support for individual pixels in the pattern. These seven patterns, with some repeats,
were placed in the form of a 4 x 4 matrix to generate the CAM for one quadrant. This same pattern is placed
on other quadrants, rotated by 90°, 180°and 270° respectively.
CZTI Detector Electronics
The CZT detector box electronics consists of
1. The front end electronics for CZT module.
2. Pre and Post amplifiers for Veto detector Cesium Iodide {CsI (Na)}.
3. Pulse height (PH) analyzer for Veto.
4. Alpha source detector CsI (Na).
5. Logic circuits to handle the data.
6. The high voltage DC/DC converters.
7. Interface circuitry for communication with CZTI Processing Electronics.
The front-end electronics is made into four identical quadrants. All analog electronics is housed in the
detector box itself and it contains ASIC control, amplifiers etc. Apart from Detector Board, Alpha card and the
Power Card, there will be one electronics card per quadrant called the FEB which includes ADCs, digital
control and FPGA.
Basic Design
One CZT module contains 2 ASICs and hence one quadrant will have 32 ASICs daisy chained to each other.A
list of major components of CZT Detector electronics is given in Table 5.3.The detector assembly consists of
the array of Detector Modules which is an integrated unit of CZT detector and ASICs, procured from Orbotech
Medical Solutions, Israel. The detector assembly contains a Detector Board with 16 CZT Modules with 32
ASICs daisy chained. An aluminized Mylar sheet of 50 micronthickness is kept on top of the detectors to
provide thermal isolation.

Veto Detector
A detector (CsI) covers the large area of 256 cm2and the light collection is done using two photomultipliers
(PMT), viewed from sides. On registering an event, a signal from the detector is sent to a pre-amplifier. This
signal is processed and sent to the FEB for further analysis. After amplification of the signal from pre-
amplifier, the signal is sent to a comparator via stretcher along with LLD level signal. If LLD is triggered the
pulse is digitized to an 8-bit output by ADC through control circuit. This output is used to differentiate
Compton scattered events and hence the background in main detector can bereduced.
Power Card
The Power card, positioned in the Crystal Holder, has a Pico high voltage generator for biasing the veto
detector. A positive high voltage around 800 V is used to bias the Photomultiplier tubes attached to Veto
detector. Similarly another negative high voltage, from another Pico DC/DC converter, is used to bias the CZT
detector. The Power Card also generates appropriate regulated low voltages for the CZT modules and it also
houses the amplifiers for the CsI detector.
Alpha - Tag
A calibration source of Am (241), is kept to shine over the detector. An energy of 60 keV is released from the
source along with an alpha particle simultaneously. This alpha particle gets detected in the CsI (Tl) detector
volume which generates the signal. The photodiode which is coupled to this CsI (Tl) detector generates an
electrical pulse, which is amplified in pre-amplifier and post-amplifiers. Post-amplifier signal is fed to an
analog comparator along with lower-level discriminator level. A relevant digitized signal generated with help
of Monoshot is passed on to FPGA as an alpha-tag event.
Front-end Electronics Board (FEB)
The FEBcontains interface circuits required for the CZT modules. A FPGA is used to handle the signals from
the three different detectors (CZT, Alpha and CsI Veto) and data is stored in a memory to be transmitted to
PE, every second. The coincidence among different detectors are done digitally by ground data processing.
86
Processing electronics
The Processing Electronics (PE) is housed separately and it contains an FPGA with an embedded processor.
The PE controls all satellite interfaces, detector interfaces and it handles onboard memory and data
management.The functions of the processing electronics includes reading, analyzing, storing and/or
transferring detector data to satellite via data formatter. Also it controls the FPGA in the FEB using 16-bit
serial commands.
There are two types of memories, namely
a. RAM: This holds all types of data like detector data and commands, telecommands and telemetry data.
c. EEPROM: This holds the basic software and the default parameters. Initially all parameters arecopied from
EEPROM and then any changes sent by telecommands are stored only in the RAM.
About FPGA: this is mainly a hardware compressor, in that it compresses the overall hardware into one single
chip. This handles the following functions:
a. Timer.
b. Detector communications.
c. Telecommands.
During an event in the detector package, the same is analyzed and stored in one of its ping-pong memory, by
its FPGA. The CPU interrogates the detector FPGA every 1 second. Upon receiving this signal the FPGA stops
storage in the first of its ping-pong memory, resumes storage of data in the second memory and, upon
command from the CPU, transfers data from the first memory to processing electronics. This FPGA based data
are stored directly into a pre-determined space in the CPU memory. Data from all the 4 quadrants are read
simultaneously (the entire data transfer at 500 kHz takes about 131 ms). The CPU then starts analyzing the
stored data according to its operating mode.
Data Organization in Detector Package
The detector package contains a FPGA to analyze data from ASICs, store it in its RAM andsend it to the
electronics package. All the ASICs are daisy chained hence the inputs and outputs of all 32 ASICs in a quadrant
are controlled by a single FEB.
Modes of Operation
The CZTI can operate in 16 possible modes. Fifteen of these are primary modes, and there is one Secondary
Spectral Modewhich runs in parallel with other primary modes. But, in normal course of operation data are
acquired in only three of them: Normal Mode, Secondary Spectral Mode and SAA mode. The description of
these modes are as follows:
Normal Mode:
This mode transmits complete raw data received from the detector box. This takes up 144 Mbytes per 100-
minute orbit. This is the default mode of operation of the CZTI.
87
SAA Mode:
When the detector is in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), or if both the CZT and the Veto High Voltage
supplies have been turned off by ground command, only header data is transmitted directly from the event
frame. The header data of each second is extracted and compiled into one quadrant header packet every 100
seconds.
Shadow Mode:
The Shadow Mode is selected if the Earth Shadow Entry command is sent from ground. In this mode the
header data of a 100-s window is sent at the 100-s boundary. The Frame/packet format is similar to the SAA
mode. Each frame contains only one packet.
Secondary Spectral Mode:
This mode runs in parallel with any other selected mode. The on-board software prepares the spectral data of
each quadrant every second. The integrated spectra so prepared is packetized and sent to the Satellite Bus
storage (Solid State Recorder) once every 100 seconds.
Reduced Data Modes
Reduced Data Modes can be entered either by ground command or due to limited memory availability. The
following reduced modes of operation are available:
Fixed No. of Packets (FP):
The frame format here is similar to the normal mode but a fixed maximum number of packets are generated
from each quadrant.
Veto Spectrum Disabled (VSD):
Packets are generated without the Veto Spectrum.
Two word event report (2WE):
The number of words representing each event is reduced from 3 (as in normal mode) to 2, by sacrificing some
resolution in time and energy.
Memory Management (MM):
The behavior of Memory Managed modes depends on the level to which the payload memory is occupied
due to the Satellite Bus storage allocated to the CZTI being full. At different levels, Full data, only Secondary
Spectral Mode data and Header data or the Header data alone could be recorded. Beyond a certain level no
data is recorded.
A number of combinations of the reduced modes are possible, e.g., SAA+Shadow, VSD+2WE, VSD+FP,
FP+2WE, FP+2WE+VSD, MM+SAA, MM+Shadow and MM+Shadow+SAA.

Data Interfaces
The two main interfaces are namely:
1) Detector Interface.
2) Satellite Interface.
Detector Interfaces:
The unit’s interface with the detector electronics unit involves the following:
Event Interface:
The FPGA of each quadrant reads data from the detectors, arranges it in the form of a 2 x 2 Kbytes frames.
This is read periodically by the processing electronics every 1 second. This data is then further analyzed and
accumulated or transmitted to the satellite via data formatter.
Command Interface:
The Command interface with the detector unit is done serially with clock & data lines.
Satellite Interfaces:
The unit’s interface with the satellite involves the following:
Power Interface:
The raw power is routed through a relay, which is switched ON/OFF by command from ground followed by a
series of transfers to the motherboard. There are two separate lines for main & redundant power.
Command Interface:
There are 13 Pulse commands & one 32-bit data command with the facility of sending data commands in a
time-tagged mode.
Telemetry Interface:
This interface is to a Solid State Recorder (SSR) via a data formatter. Data is sent periodically, typically every 8
ms, to the formatter in the form of 2 Kbytes frame at 2MHz clock rate.
Background Estimation
The sources of background in the CZT detector are primarily cosmic diffuse gamma rays and gamma-rays
originating from the satellite structure (spallation background) due to the interaction of cosmic rays.
To distinguish these background counts from the real source counts a slab of CsI is placed under each block of
CZT. The high energy photons which deposit energy in CsI as well as CZT are rejected by anti coincidence
techniques and hence do not contribute to the background counts in CZT. Only the photons which deposit
partial energy in CZT but do not interact in the CsI block generate background counts in the (10 - 100) keV
region.
89
Compton Induced Background
Assuming an outer space environment where the satellite is deployed, some of the background count
estimates have been simulated and the values are described here. The total number of background counts in
the CZT due to single Compton scattering are calculated by summing up all the contributions over the entire
energy range of injected gamma rays and the typical counts are about 20 counts/sec for CsI thickness of 2 cm.
Fluorescent K-alphaBackground
Cosmic diffuse gamma ray photons in the energy range (10 - 100) keV interacts with Tantalum by photo-
electric effect and produce fluorescent Kα X-rays. The fluorescent X-ray contribution to background
contributions can be divided in 3 parts:
(a) Contribution from the top surface,
This surface is made up of Tantalum of thickness 0.5 mm. The total area of a module is 15.25 cm2 but the
effective area is half that due to the random holes of the CAM. It is far from the detector and subtends a
small solid angle at the detector plane. The total counts from this surface are about 0.0025 counts / sec.
(b) Contribution from 4 cm x 36 cm upper side surfaces.
This side is made of Tantalum sheet of area 4 cm x 36 cm and thickness 0.1 mm. Though this surface is large
compared to the detector surface, it is perpendicular to detector plane and makes a small solid angle to the
detector. The total count from this surface is about 0.41 counts / sec.
(c) Contribution from 20 cm x 14 cm lower side surfaces.
This is the lower portion of the side surface and as it is closer to the detector it contributes the maximum. The
numbers of counts at the detector depends very much on the height of the side surface. The total counts
from this surface are about 5 counts/sec.
Data Analysis
Image Reconstruction
The standard procedure adopted for image reconstruction will consist of first binning the data to produce a
detector plane image (DPI), which is then cross correlated with the mask pattern. Significant peaks from this
image are picked and a least square fit is then made of the DPI with theoretically computed shadow patterns
for sources these locations. This allows accurate determination of the intensities of these sources, and also
helps identify and eliminate spurious peaks that might have been picked from the cross-correlated image.
Operation Sequence to generate the Data products
 Step 1: Download telemetry data for an observation period.
 Step 2: The good time interval file is generated using the house keeping information
 Step 3: Read the attitude information and generate average position of the satellite for the period of
observation.
 Step 4: Extract the relevant data and generate the raw DPH or raw DPI.
 Step 5: The detector data (DPH) is processed to generate information about noisy and dead pixels for
the time of observation.
90
 Step 6: Using information generated in steps 3 and 5, process the raw DPH/ DPI and clean them.
Generate a detector mask file that records the pixels removed in the cleaning process.
 Step 7: Perform cross-correlation imaging and pick candidate sources from the image
 Step 8: Perform shadow fitting to estimate fluxes of candidate sources, reject insignificant candidates
and iterate until all sources have fitted flux values above the detection threshold. (In generating
shadow patterns for fitting the detector mask must be accounted for).
Ground Calibration of CZT Imager
The CZT detector modules, procured from Orbotech Medical Solutions, are meant for commercial use. To
qualify these detectors for flight, a rigorous screening procedure was evolved. After the screening process, it
was found that the yield was very low (about 65%). It was noticed that the number of noisy pixels increased
after screening, resulting in the rejection of a large number of modules (acceptance criterion is that the
number of dead+noisy+bad pixels out of the 256 pixels in a given detector should be less than 15). The CZT
detector modules are primarily designed as gamma-ray devices (40 – 200 keV) to be operated at room
temperatures. To extend the low energy response to 10 keV, the devices are cooled to 10°C (+/- 5°C) – but in
some orbits the temperature can go up to 20°C.
The ground calibration of CZT-Imager payload was done in the following manner. Time tagging and
polarization abilities are examined at individual module level. The assembled quadrants are calibrated at
multiple temperatures to understand the spectral response at individual pixel level. The fully assembled
payload is calibrated to understand the a) imaging behavior, b) veto tagging efficiency and c) alpha-tagging
efficiency.
Characterization of individual pixels
Individual pixels are characterized as dead (D) pixels defined as pixels having no sensitivity to detect X-rays,
noisy (N) pixelsdefined as pixels having counts more than 5-sigma above the mean and bad (B) pixelsdefined
as pixels whose energy resolution is significantly worse as compared to the other pixels. The characteristics
of the pixels are monitored regularly and each module is given a grade based on the number of dead
andnoisy pixels and their degradation with time, based on the criterion given in Table 5.3.The distribution of
the grades of 64 modules in the individual quadrants are given in Table 5.4 and it is found that 84% of the
modules belong to Very Good or Good category. Noise is also found to be a function of temperature and
energy threshold and the final energy threshold that can be achieved at various temperatures are given in
Table 5.5 and the number of suppressed pixels are given in Table 5.6. It is found that a threshold of 10 – 15
keV can be achieved in a majority of modules with less than 5% of pixels being suppressed.

X-ray spectroscopic calibration at various temperatures
Calibration data were obtained by shining various radioactive sources (241Am, 57Co and 109Cd) on the
quadrants at various temperatures. For automatic analysis, monochromatic lines are modeled as a Gaussian
in a region around the peak (−1σ’ to +2σ’ of the channel with highest counts, where σ’ is the approximate
Gaussian σ). The mapping between ADC channels and energy (keV) is given by,
Energy = Channels × Gain + Offset
Gains and offsets measured for all pixels at different temperatures. A typical energy spectrum is shown in
Figure 5.4. In most detector modules, inter-pixel gain variations are small (< 10%). The typical energy
resolution is shown in Figure 5.5. The energy resolution at 22 keV and 33 keV are likely to be overestimates
because the line blends at these energies are not segregated. There is a marginal change in gain and energy
resolution as a function of temperature in 0 – 15 keV region. For onboard response calculation, however, the
measured gain and spectral response at each temperature will be used.
Figure 5.4 Spectra for different energies Fig 5.5 Energy resolution as a function of energy
Coded Aperture Mask (CAM) Calibration
The shadow patterns of the CAM and the coding techniques are tested to check the efficiency of the coding
device to the given radiation. This is done by shining strong radioactive sources at known fixed positions,
typically 100 – 200 cm above the mask. The radiation from the source, on its way to the CZT detector, was
intercepted by the coded mask plate situated at a height of 48 cm above the detector. The photons detected
by the CZT module were accumulated into an event list, recording the position (pixel number), energy (PHA
channel number) and time of each event plane. These data were then analysed using the CZTI imaging
algorithm and the location of the source thus reconstructed was compared with the position at which the
radioactive source was placed during the acquisition of the data. The reconstruction process began by
counting the total number of events recorded in each detector pixel, resulting in a Detector Plane Histogram
(DPH). Each count value in the DPH was then divided by the relative quantum efficiency of the corresponding
pixel. The array resulting from this is called a Detector Plane Image (DPI). This DPI is a linear combination of
shadows of the coded mask cast on the detector plane by sources in the field of view. Alibrary of shadow
patterns expected from sources located at different positions on the source plane was created by a ray
tracing method. Different methods like Cross correlation, chi-square shadow fitting, and Richardson-Lucy
algorithm (based on Bayesian inference), were applied to get the source position. It was found that results
from the three different methods agree well, to better than 2 arcmin. The test was repeated at two different
93
energies (60 keV and 122 keV) and it was found that at 122 keV, the PSF is seen to widen slightly, by about
10%. Above 100 keV the mask plate begins to become transparent, reducing shadow contrast and worsening
the imaging capability. The results, however, show that decent imaging would still be possible at energies as
high as 120 keV, with a PSF of less than ~4 arcmin FWHM.
Field of View of the CZT imager
The Field of View (FoV) of the CZT imager is energy dependent due to greater transparency of the collimator
material at higher photon energies. The angular response pattern contains a central core of ~6 deg radius
which is common to all energies, and represents the view through the top coded mask surface. Transmission
through the collimator slats and side walls contribute wings to the response pattern, the relative strength of
which rises with increasing energy. The FoV may therefore be quantified as the amount of solid angle the
response pattern covers at a given fraction of the peak on-axis response. It is to be noted that not all of this
coverage may be contiguous. We compute the FoV by summing the solid angle of all parts of the effective
area distribution that rise above a specified fraction of the on-axis value. The resulting estimates, for
different photon energies, are presented in the Fig. 5.6. The FoV evaluated at 50%, 20% and 10% of the peak
response at each energy is shown. The FoV increases monotonically with photon energy, apart from a bump
near 67 keV due to Tantalum K escape.
Fig. 5.6 Field of View of the CZT Imager as a function of energy
Effective Area of the CZT Imager
The effective area of the CZT Imager as a function of photon energy and illumination angle has been
estimated by accounting for the energy-dependent transmission through the various surfaces making up the
CZTI structure, and the energy-dependent absorption by the CZT detector, at different angles of incidence.
The result is shown in Fig. 5.7 below. The local peak in effective area near 67 keV occurs due to Tantalum K
escape.
94

Alpha-tagging in CZTI
A 10 mm3CsI(Tl) crystal, embedded with a radioactive source 241Am and viewed by a photodiode of 10 mm2
area, is placed beside the CZT detector. With each disintegration of the 60 keV photon from this source, an
Alpha particle (energy about 5 MeV) is also emitted. The alpha particle is absorbed in the small CsI(Tl)
detector, whereas the 60 keV X-rays will escape from this detector and, in most cases, will interact with the
CZT detector. The alpha particle produces a light pulse in the CsI(Tl) crystal, which in turn is converted into an
electrical pulse at the output of the photo-diode. Any output in the CZT detector coincident with the pulse
output from the CsI(Tl) detector is deemed to be originating from a 60 keV photon. This method is used to
calibrate the energy response of the CZT detector for its energy response.The basic design principles are
discussed in Rao et al. (2010, NIMPA. 616, 55) and it was estimated that, for an alpha source strength of
1000/s, about 20 – 30 60 keV X-rays should be emerging from the alpha module. The time co-incidence was
done digitally and this aspect is rigorously tested in the QM and one FM detector. The tunable parameters
were examined carefully, and it was found that the alpha-tagged information can indeed be extracted from
the data. However, the flight configuration is such that the final alpha count rate is as low as ~1 count/s,
necessitating a large integration time, grouping of pixels, and use of background lines for the onboard
calibration.
95
Veto calibration
The veto detector is a 20 mm thick CsI(Tl) scintillation, of size 167 mm X 167 mm, viewed by two one inch
Photo-multiplier tubes (PMT) positioned at two sides of the crystal. Minimum detection sensitivity is 50 keV
for incident photons. The main purpose of this detector is to recognize background X-ray/ gamma-ray
radiation (above 100 keV) and tag the main X-ray events (in the CZT detector) with the information that the X-
rays are accompanied by a background X-ray/ gamma-ray. The energy resolution of this detector is not
significant. These detectors are procured from Scionix Holland, the same suppliers who have provided the RT-
2 phoswich detectors and the ACS system for Chandrayaan-I. For the CZT-Imager, it was decided to carry out a
minimum screening of 10 cycles of thermo-vac cycling (passive). The temperature range was -20 to +50° C.
The HV parts were potted with HV 93-500 and the screening and thermo-vac tests were done after the
potting. It was found that the gain uniformity over the area is correct to 10%.After the FM assemblies, the
amplifier gain was adjusted so that the upper level corresponds to about 500 – 600 keV. The LLD, however,
can be changed by command. The test resultsshow that the peak position is linear with energy.
The Veto detector is designed to capture the forward scattered gamma-rays. In the laboratory, it is quite
difficult to reproduce this result because any gamma-ray source, like 133Ba, has a low energy line with much
higher probability of interaction. It was, however, possible to capture the Compton scattered events by
restricting the energy range of CZT detectors to a narrow window of 40 – 70 keV (to detect only the Compton
scattered events). When plotted against the coincidence window time, at > 12 micro-seconds, the data shows
the expected coincidence events (about 10% of the total events).
Time tagging and polarization
In CZT-Imager, individual photons are tagged to an accuracy of 20 micro-seconds. The onboard clock is logged
every 16 seconds based on a pulse coming from the Satellite Positioning System (SPS) and ground calibrations
show that the PE time can be correlated to SPS time correct to about 2 microsec. The pixilated nature of the
detector can be used for measuring the polarization of the incident X-ray photons based on the principle of
Compton scattering by detecting the Compton scattering event in one pixel and the scattered photon in
another pixel. However this requires the capability of recording two simultaneous events in different pixels.
The ability of CZT modules to detect polarization has been verified in the laboratory. Details of this
experiment is given in Vadawale et al. (2015; A&A submitted) and in Fig 5.8 we show the fitted and the
experimentally observed modulation patterns demonstrating that CZT-Imager is capable of measuring
polarization of bright onboard sources (> 500 mCrab) in the 100 – 300 keV region.
96
Fig 5.8: Experimentally measured modulation curves for partially polarized X-rays at two polarization angles.
Response matrix generation
Mono-energetic lines detected by CZT detectors have a long tail toward low-energiesoriginating from the
partial charge collection due to ‘hole-trapping’. This is modeled in terms of crystal charge transport
properties. CZT detector line profile and its dependence on the basic parameter is well understood and the
model is implemented in IDL, S-Lang (available in ISIS as a local model) and the ‘mobility lifetime’ products for
charge carriers are obtained by simultaneous fit to individual pixel spectra at multiple energies. Sufficient
calibration data are available to generate pixel wise parameters at multiple temperatures (gain, offset,
resolution, and otherline parameters) and a flow chart is given below (fig.5.9).
97
Figure 5.9: Flow-chart for multi-pixel response matrix generation
Onboard Performance of CZT Imager
Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager was made fully operational on October 5, 2015, Day 8 of Astrosat. The
structured onboard software worked in an autonomous fashion, and the general health of the instrument
was found to be normal. The genaral behaviour of the alpha and Veto counts are found to be steady.
Pixels disabled:
Whenever a pixel becomes noisy and floods the data for a long duration, it is being disabled. There is a
provision to enable the pixels which have been disabled. The total number of pixels disabled during ground
calibration as well as onboard operation till 30-03-2016 are as shown in the following table.
Quadrant 1 Quadrant 2 Quadrant 3 Quadrant 4
Ground 204 216 127 209
On-orbit 82 114 67 147
Total 286 330 194 356
98
The total pixels disabled are 1166(7.12%). It is found that roughly about once in a fortnight a few pixels (less
than 5) need to be disabled further. Hence it is estimated that the total number of disabled pixels during the
five year life of the instrument would be within the design goal of 10%.
CZT module thresholds:
Before launch most of the CZT modules were set at 40keV for room temperature operation. The thresholds
were reduced on-board when the detector temperatures got stabilized. The following are the thresholds
values as on 30-03-2016. A majority of modules (49, i.e. 76.6%) are set at 15 keVthreshold and 9 modules
(14%) are at 20 or 25 keV threshold and a small number (6 modules) are at 40 or 50 keV threshold.

SAA region:
CZTI payload enters the SAA mode based on the warning signal from CPM or through telecommand from
ground. After evaluating the CPM performance on board, the CZTI SAA Entry and Exit logic has beenenabled
through CPM. If the number of counts detected by CPM exceeds 14 in 5 seconds, it sends a warning signal to
CZTI and the high voltages are switched off, causing the payload to enter mode 9. On exiting from SAA region,
the high voltages are switched ON and the payload come backs to the normal mode (mode 0).
99
Operational modes:
The CZTI payload is always being operated in normal mode (mode 0) post launch. During SAA passage, if the
charged particle counts are greater than the set threshold, it goes to mode 9 and returns to mode 0 when the
charged particle counts drop below threshold. If the on-board satellite memory is full, the satellite BDH would
send a memory full signal to CZTI. However such a situation has not so far been encountered in orbit. In
future if the CZTI payload receives a memory full signal from satellite BDH, it will go to mode 4(memory level
=1) or mode 12(memory level > 1) or mode 13(memory level > 1 + SAA warning). In these modes the data are
acquired at a reduced rate and are stored in CZTI internal RAM. After memory full is released, the data stored
internally are sent to the on-board satellite memory.
Onboard software:
CZTI processing electronics can hold four versions of onboard software in its EEPROM. Before launch, all the
four versions held the same software. Post launch, it has been noticed that the cosmic ray interactions with
the CZT detectors is very prominent, thus creating many false events in the detectors. To reduce these events,
a new software has been uploaded to page 2 of EEPROM. The number of CZT events per Quadrant per second
has been reduced from a value of 1200 before the software update to a value of 400 after the software
update.
Timing parameters:
The timing parameters T1 to T7 for alpha and veto event association have been calibrated on board and the
following optimized values are obtained.
Parameter T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7
Time(us) 1 8 20 15 40 10 62
CZT module temperatures:
The average module temperature is being maintained at 12°C with a 3°C variation.
Background counts:
The CZT and veto detector background is varying uniformly with time with the CZT background count rate
range of 80 to 120 counts/second/Quadrant and veto background count range of 300 to 450 counts/ second/
Quadrant.
Timing accuracy:
In 16 seconds, the time difference between CZTI clock and STBG clock is around 30 micro seconds and it is
constant through out the operation period indicating the stable behavior of CZTI clock.

Scanning Sky Monitor
The science objective of SSM is to scan a large portion of the sky every few hours to detect and locate
transient X-ray sources in the outburst phase, in the energy band of 2.5 to 10 keV. Therefore, it is
required that SSM has a large field of view (FOV) with a good angular resolution so that once detected
the position of the sources is known to a few arcmin resolution in sky co-ordinates. This is to enable
other instruments on ASTROSAT and ground based observatories to conduct detailed observations of
the source. In addition to this, SSM will observe known transient X-ray sources in its subsequent scans
which will be used to generate long term light curves of these binary systems. This will help study of
long term behavior of the observed transient systems.
Instrument Description
SSM consists of three nearly identical one dimensional position sensitive gas-filled proportional counters
with a coded-mask and associated electronics, each having a FOV of the order of ~22o × 100o (for edge
SSM) and ~26.8o × 100o (for centre SSM). The assembly is mounted on a platform which can be rotated
to scan the sky. Figure below (Fig. 6.1) shows the picture of the three units of SSM mounted on a single
platform. SSM is composed of the following elements: detectors, the associated electronics, imaging
element (coded-mask), platform, motor and its electronics.
Figure 6.1 : Scanning Sky Monitor: Each of the three SSM cameras have their own electronics system. The Central SSM will point
towards the +Yaw axis, while the two Edge SSMs will be canted away by 45o from that axis. The entire assembly will rotate
about the +Yaw axis.
101
The instrumentation for SSM including the detectors and electronics is developed at Space Astronomy
Group at ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC), Bangalore. The design and fabrication of the platform is by CMSE,
VSSC, the mechanism and motor is by SMG, ISAC, and the drive electronics and commanding is provided
by CSG, ISAC. The assembly and integration of the complete payload was carried out at ISAC, Bangalore.
SSM instrument is sensitive in the energy range 2.5 to 10 keV. The window of SSM is aluminized Mylar
of thickness 50 microns and this limits the detection efficiency at 2.5 keV. Effective area of SSM at 5 keV
is 33 cm2 and that at 2.5 keV is 7 cm2. SSM detectors are position sensitive detectors, position resolution
of SSM at 6 keV is ~1 mm. Angular resolution of SSM is ~12 arcmin in the coding direction and that
across is 2.50. Energy resolution of SSM is ~25% at 6 keV. Sensitivity of SSM is ~28 milliCrab for 10
minutes integration at 3sigma. Figure 6.2 shows the sensitivity curve for SSM.
Figure 6.2: Sensitivity of SSM
Detectors for SSM:
All three units for SSM have a position-sensitive proportional counter as the detector element. The detectors
are multi-wire position sensitive proportional counters. There are eight anodes in each detector and the
anodes are powered with a high voltage (HV) of the order of 1500 volts as compared to that of cathodes which
are at zero potential. Many such cells (as shown in figure below) constitute the geometric area of a detector.
These cells are enclosed in a gas-filled chamber having an entrance window thin enough to allow the incident
X-ray photons into the counter. Figure 6.3 shows the schematic view of the cells .

inside an SSM detector. The top layer consists of position-sensitive anode wires surrounded by wire-walled
cathode forming individual cells. Figure 6.4 shows the photo of the wire module inside the detector.
Figure 6.3 : Schematic view of SSM cells. Only one of the cells is shown lengthwise, with a photon incident on the cell
producing charge cloud at the anode.
Principle of Operation
When an X-ray photon enters the gas chamber it ionizes the gas by photo-electric effect which leads to
formation of several electron-ion pairs. The electrons are accelerated towards the anode resulting in
further multiplication of the charge which is collected at the anode. In a position-sensitive detector the
anode being
Figure 6.4 : Wire module kept inside the detector
resistive, the charge is proportionately divided to the two ends depending on the position where the
charge cloud is collected along the anode wire. This charge is converted into voltage using a charge
sensitive preamplifier (CSPA) at both the ends.
The corresponding voltage pulses at either ends of the anode are referred to as left (V ) and right (V )
L R
outputs of the anode. The total amplitude of both the outputs is proportional to the energy of the
103
incident photon. The position (P) of the incident photon on the detector plane is given by
P=((A*R)+B)/(R+C), where ratio, R = (V -V )/(V+V ), V and V are the amplitudes of the left and right
L R L R L R
output pulses and A, B and C are the calibration constants of that particular anode on which the photon
is incident.
The SSM detector plane consists of two layers of wire-cells, central eight of the top layer being active
anode cells. The two edge cells of the top layer and the ten cells in the bottom layer are all connected
together to form the background or veto layer. The information that we get about every photon that is
incident on the detector are 1. Time of arrival, 2. Energy and 3. Position of incidence.
Design of Mask
Six different coded mask patterns with 50% transparency are joined to make the complete mask plate
as shown in figure 6.5. The design of the coded mask and the deconvolution software is developed in

Electronics for SSM
The Electronics system for SSM is composed of three units: (a) Charge Sensitive Pre-Amplifiers (CSPA)
and post amplifiers (PA), (b) Front end electronics consisting of low voltage DC-DCs, HV programmer,
logic unit for LLD/ULD/event-analysis, peak detectors, ADC, etc and (c) the Processing Electronics (PE)
consisting of FPGA based system for event processing, buffer memory, telecommand and telemetry
interfaces and the interface circuits for data transfer to Data Handling package. The detector is powered
using High Voltage distribution unit mounted behind the detector. Figure 6.6 shows the block diagram of
the detector with the electronics.

Figure 6.6 : Block diagram of the Electronics System of SSM
Processing of an event:
The charge collected at the anode for every photon incident is converted to a voltage pulse using a CSPA
on either sides of the anode. The CSPA output is further shaped and amplified. There are seventeen such
chains for each SSM detector unit, sixteen of them are connected to both ends of eight anodes and one
of them is connected to the veto layer. The front end logic unit processes signals from each of these
chains. Event outputs between Lower Level Discriminator (LLD) and Upper Level Discriminator (ULD) are
accepted for processing. Charge particle rejection is done by the technique called anti-coincidence,
where the event is rejected when (a) signals are present in both the top anode layer as well as the
bottom veto layer simultaneously, or (b) more than one anode has an event simultaneously. The
amplitude of every accepted event is measured and digitised and then the ADC output of each event,
both left and right sides, are sent to the PE unit. In addition several channels regarding count rates of the
anodes and veto, etc. are also sent to the PE. The PE which is a FPGA-based unit accepts these events,
stores them in buffer memory and interfaces with the Data Handling system of the spacecraft. The PE
also acts as both telecommand and telemetry interface for the complete SSM electronics system. The
time of incidence of every photon is tagged with the event by the PE using an onboard SSM clock. This
clock is periodically synchronised with the spacecraft BMU clock. In addition, the electronics system also
has circuitry for sensing and reducing High Voltage during high charge particle regions based on
command-set thresholds and also corona sensing with auto-shutoff. Data from the PE is sent from the
buffer memory through Data Handling and stored in the main spacecraft Solid State Recorder package
for readout during visibilities. The detector and front end electronics packages are mounted on a
rotating platform on the anti sun side of the spacecraft whereas the processing electronics is mounted
inside the S/C. A flexible cable bunch is used between the packages.

Table 6.1 : Technical details of SSM
Ground calibration
SSM ground calibration includes spectral and positional calibration. Spectral calibration has been done
to study and keep track of the gain of the detectors for SSM. Positional calibration of SSM gives the
calibration constants to derive the position of every photon incident on the detector.
Spectral calibration
SSM detector is calibrated for spectral response at different energies in the range of interest. The energy
range of interest for SSM is 2.5 keV to 10 keV. The detector is calibrated at different energies to derive
the Energy-vs-Channel relation and the Energy-vs-FWHM relation at different energies. These relations
are required to generate the response matrix of the detector. The position resolution at different
energies is also estimated for SSM.
Characteristic X-rays are used to calibrate the detector at different energies. The photon energies used
to calibrate the detector are Ca K (3.69 keV), Ti K (4.51 keV), Mn K (5.89 keV, Fe-55 radioactive source)
α α α
and Cu K (8.04 keV). Ca K , Ti Kα and Cu K are produced by shining the continuum spectrum of an X-
α α α
ray gun onto foils of respective materials to produce the characteristic X-rays. Thus, the detector is
calibrated with four different X-ray sources within the energy range of interest.
106
Positional calibration
The position of a photon incident on the detector is determined from the ratio of the charge collected
on either sides of the anode. It has been observed that for photons incident at the geometric centre of
the anode, the left and the right output amplitudes are not the same and hence the calculated position
using the charge ratio from the output pulses does not match with the geometric position. Therefore, it
is required to calibrate the detector for its positional response and to get the correction factor, which are
called the anode calibration constants, with respect to every anode in the detector.
On-board Calibration
Calibration with Crab nebula
Calibration of SSM includes imaging aspects, sensitivity and gain of the detectors on SSM. Crab nebula
has been observed for detailed calibration of SSM for all different aspects of the payload. During the PV
phase, all three units of SSM have been pointed to Crab and observations were done with Crab at
different locations in the FOV of each of the three cameras of SSM. Data from observations of Crab have
been processed to refine the calibration database for imaging from that obtained on-ground. Any
change in sensitivity of the instrument is calibrated with Crab observations.
Also any gain change in the cameras can be identified with the change in hardness ratio obtained from x-
ray sky observations.
The hardness ratio (HR2) is the ratio of the flux in the energy bands 6 to 10 keV and 4 to 6 keV. Any 10%
variation in the gas gain can be detected from the variations in the hardness ratio calculated from
observations of Crab nebula as well as sky observations. For any variation in the gain of the detector,
the operating voltage of SSM can be tuned to bring it back to the nominally operating gain value.
Crab has been observed with SSM at various stages during the PV phase for all the above calibration
aspects.
SSM Data
Data from SSM detectors are of two types, temporal and time-tagged. The temporal data gives the
counts detected by the detector every 100 ms and the time-tagged data gives the information of every
event detected in the detector. From the time-tagged data information like energy of the incident
photon, position of incidence can be calculated. Using this data the shadow pattern cast by different
sources in the FOV of SSM is derived, which is later used to derive the position and flux of the sources in
the FOV.
SSM2 unit, one of the edge cameras has been switched OFF since August 2016, as it developed gas leak.
SSM with its two units, SSM1 (one of the edge cameras) and SSM3 (the central camera) is continuing to
observe the X-ray sky with its step and stare mode of operation.
SSM Deliverables
The Light curves of different sources in the FOV will be generated and will be made available to the
public in the SSM website. The light curve in 4 different bands (2.5-10, 2.5-4, 4-6 and 6-10 keV) and the
hardness ratios are expected to be also made available in the SSM page at ISSDC website.

Charged Particle Monitor
S
atellites in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) pass through the
trapped radiation belts of the South Atlantic Anomaly
(SAA), where the particle environment can change very
drastically within a few tens of seconds. Due to the
high density of energetic particles (mostly protons), there
could be adverse scientific and technological effects on the
instruments in the satellites like, glitches in the data, aging of
the scientific instruments and even permanent damage to the
detectors. Hence, this region should be monitored properly
and precautions should be taken to protect the scientific
instruments during the satellite’s passage through the SAA
region. The Charge Particle Monitor (CPM) for AstroSat warns
the satellite instruments about the entry and exit points of
the SAA region and thus serves the purpose of a monitor. A
Figure 7.1: The Flight Model of AstroSat CPM
picture of the Flight Model of CPM is given in Fig 7.1.
SAA occurs at altitudes above about 500 km spanning -500 to 00 l atitude and -900 to +400 longitude. This
SAA region changes slowly over time, the dominant drift being w estward of approximately 0.3 degrees
per year. AstroSat is in a 650 km near-equatorial (60 latitude) orbit and it encounters SAA in a few of its 14
orbits per day, spending 10 – 20 minutes in the SAA region, each t ime. CPM senses the SAA by measuring
the total number of charged particles, above a certain energy threshold. Typically, the particle rate is < 1
particle per cm2 and it can shoot upto> 1000 particle per cm2 in the SAA region, with a rise/fall time of
SAA entry/exit of about 40 s. The particle number spectrum as a function of energy is flat upto about 100
MeV and it falls down sharply above this energy. The CPM is desig ned keeping these factors in mind, viz.,
Fig 1.
a small area particle detector giving the total number of particle counts above about an MeV in an
integration time of a few seconds.
The detector used for CPM is a CsI(Tl) scintillation detector of open area 1 cm2. The total material covering
the detector like the 0.12 mm Teflon light reflector, a thin Copper box acting as a radiation shield and 50
micron aluminized Mylar as the entrance window of the CPM box, etc. have a combined equivalent
proton range of about 1 MeV and hence the CPM is sensitive to all protons above about 1.5 MeV. CsI(Tl)
is preferred over more common NaI(Tl), because the latter is hygroscopic in nature. Ionising radiations
create photons in the scintillating crystal and they are captured by a Si-Pin diode placed at the bottom
surface of the CsI(Tl) crystal. This crystal and photodiode assembly is very cost effective compared to
108
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
semiconductor detectors, and lighter than scintillator photomultiplier assembly (as used in RXTE).
Moreover, the photomultiplier needs high voltage biasing and the gain may vary with time. The detector
and the readout used for AstroSat CPM does not require high voltage for biasing and it is designed to be
rugged, compact and reliable.
Instrument details
The CPM is designed as a stand-alone instrument of AstroSat, with its own power module, tele-command
and telemetry interfaces. The instrument characteristics are given in Table 1. The basic detector, as
explained earlier, is a CsI(Tl) scintillator coupled to a Si-PIN photo-diode. The detector light output peaks
at 580 nm and the light intensity is proportional to the energy of the incident radiation. This light is
proportionally converted to an electrical signal by the photodiode. A charge sensitive preamplifier (CSPA)
is used to amplify the photodiode output to milli-volt range. The detector, photodiode and CSPA are
combined in a compact 1 cm3 box made by SCIONIX, Holland to form the detector module.
The detector module is mounted on an electronics card along with other electronics like amplifiers,
discriminators, and an FPGA for handling interfaces and detector logic. A Power Module, mounted below
this card generates +5 V,+12 V,-12 V voltages from Satellite Raw Bus of +42 Volts and consumes about 4
W power. The +5 V supply is used to power the CPM logic circuits, +12 V and –12 V supplies are used to
power detector and amplifier circuits.
The detector module generates a pulse corresponding to every incident energetic particle and this pulse
is passed through a post amplifier, where milli-volt signal is converted to volt level. The total gain of
amplifier is kept around 500 with sufficient bandwidth such that it generates 0.5 microsecond rise time
pulses. These amplified pulses are passed through a Low Level Discriminator (LLD) circuit to cut-off noise
and select the charge particle signals above a defined value of about 0.5 MeV. The LLD reference voltage
value is programmable from ground station through telecommand. It is a 12-bit DAC and 4096 discrete
values are possible. The pulse signal from LLD circuit output is digitized and fed to a 14-bit counter. The
14-bit counter is a free running counter gated every 5 sec (default). Gate time is also programmable from
ground through telecommand. All digital processing electronics is embedded in the FPGA. The telemetry
and telecommand interface with the satellite bus is also embedded in the FPGA. The general health of the
instrument is monitored through the analog channels of satellite telemetry.
Ground Calibration of CPM
The calibration of CPM involves proton and gamma-ray energy calibration in the Engineering Model (EM)
and gamma ray energy calibration for the Qualification Model (QM) and Flight Model (FM). Since the
output from CPM contains only counts above a set threshold, successively changing the threshold and
getting an integral spectrum can obtain spectrum of the incoming radiation. This integral spectrum can be
converted to a conventional energy spectrum by simple differentiation. The underlining assumption is that
the spectrum remains unchanged during the course of observation. During all environmental tests and
satellite integration tests, the record of background counts for a threshold of 0.5 MeV are kept and the
requirement is that this background counts should be stable within 50%.

The proton sensitivity test and linearity checking was done with proton beams of energies 15 MeV, 17
MeV and 18 MeV from the 14 MV BARC-TIFR Pelletron accelerator. The response was found to be
linear and it is found to be 0.47 mV/keV, which is slightly greater than the photon response (0.40 mV/keV).
This is due to the fact that the light output of CsI(Tl), and hence the relative pulse height is lower for γ ray
photon than protons. Also we find that the proton sensitivity of the detector is linear locally, but has some
non-linearity in the lower part of the spectrum.
The gamma-ray response was found using Ba133, Cs137 and Eu152 radioactive sources, with energies: 356
keV (Ba), 662 keV (Cs), 1112 keV (Eu) and 1408 keV (Eu). The spectra are obtained by differentiating the
integral spectrum. A comparison of the peaks obtained form 662 keV (Cs) source by this method and the
direct MCA method (during card level testing) is shown below. Since CPM generates only counts above a
LLD channel, all spectral information are given in the units of LLD channel numbers.
Figure 7.2: A comparison of spectrum obtained directly and by differentiating the integral spectrum
110
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
The observed peak position (LLD channel numbers) for the Flight Model are given in Table 2. The
response is linear with a slope of 0.45±0.05 LLD channel/keV and an intercept of -58±33 LLD channels.
The peak position was found to be stable correct to 5% in the temperature range 0 – 40 °C and decreased by
10% at 50 °C. The operating temperature of CPM is 0 – 50 °C.
It is estimated that gamma-ray bursts and solar gamma-ray flares which give a measurable count (> 10
counts/s) above 0.5 MeV occur very rarely (a rate of less than once per year). The time-scale for detecting
the entry and exit of SAA would be kept large enough to ignore even such rare events. During calibration,
the system was also found to be stable when a large number of low energy (6 keV) photons are bombarded
on the detector, demonstrating that a stable particle rate measurement is possible even in the presence of
intense solar flares.

CPM data availability
The CPM count rate is transmitted through telemetry to ground station. It is also available for onboard
users (or payloads) in serial format as Data, Clock and a Latch. A maximum of three users can be
supported.
This count rate is compared with a preset value set from ground station through telecommand. Whenever
count rate is greater than a preset value the output is activated. The output is de-activated whenever the
count rate is less than the preset value. To avoid false triggering, output is activated/de-activated only
after 3 successive confirmation of count rate. This SAA warning outputs are available for users. Maximum
eight such users can be supported.
The energy threshold of CPM is nominally set at 0.5 MeV and this can be changed unto 10 MeV with a few
keV steps. The count threshold for the automatic onboard sensing of SAA can be set from 1 to 16384
counts with a step of 1 count and the integration time can be set from 1 s to 32 s with a step of 1 s.
Additionally, there is a command facility to automatically step up the energy threshold so that, at stable
non-SAA regions, integral energy spectrum can be obtained.
As a back up to CPM, AstroSat uses time tagged commands to alert the entry/exit of SAA, based on a SAA
model. The measured intensity of energetic charge particle rates from CPM will be used to refine this
model periodically.
111
AS T R OS AT H AN DB OO K
Onboard testing
The operation of CPM started from 2015 September 29, a day after the launch of AstroSat. The threshold
for registering protons is kept at 1 MeV. The integration time for the device is kept at 5 s and the count
threshold for SAA trigger is kept at 14 counts (corresponding to a rate of 2.8 counts/s). The duration of the
time spent in SAA region varies with orbit which causes the variation in observed the peak count rate. The
maximum observed peak rate is around 400 counts/s. It is also observed for some orbits the satellite does
not pass through SAA. Currently only CZTI is using the SAA trigger signal. The rest of the payloads are
using the backup model.
Stability issues in the detector can occur due to continuous bombardment with high energy particles. To
evaluate the stability, flight range was divided into bins of 1o by 1o. Mean and standard deviation of count
rate was evaluated for each bin. For non-SAA region the mean count rates is found to be less than 1. For
SAA region, higher counts and thus higher mean is expected. This was also observed in the data from
CPM. Monthly contour maps of the SAA region were also generated which show similar shape, indicating
the stability of the detector.
Figure 7.3 Left: A Light curve of particle rates as observed by CPM. The recurring peaks denote the
section of SAA region traversed in an orbit. The highest peak denotes when the satellite ventured deepest
into the SAA region. Right: Contour maps of SAA region. Count rate data for a month was spatially
binned and contour maps were generated. The sharp transition to SAA can be seen and accordingly the
threshold was kept at 2.8 counts/s. Counts greater than 15 counts/s are shown in light blue for a better
depiction of the transition region.

Observing with AstroSat
AstroSat orbit
Based on the requirements of the useful lifetime, low background of charged
particles and considering the PSLV capability, a 650-Km, 6-deg inclined orbit is
selected for the AstroSat. No orbit maintenance is envisaged for the AstroSat. The
altitude of the spacecraft is not important for the scientific payloads, and the only
criterion is that the orbit should be sustainable for more than 5 years without re-
entry due to aerodynamic drag. The osculating nominal elements of the AstroSat
Spacecraft are provided in Table given below:

 South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA)
The extent of SAA spread for 650 km orbit has been provided in Fig.8.1 as given
below :
113
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
Fig.8.1: Extent of SAA region
It can be seen that the SAA covers -5 S to -50 S in latitude. In order to reduce
the effect of SAA, the satellite is to be placed in low inclination orbit. SAA
cannot be completely avoided. Keeping some safety margins, it is decided to
keep an inclination of 6 with an orbital height of 650 km for ASTROSAT satellite.
But from the comfortable elevation for the primary station Bangalore for
ASTROSAT, 8 degree inclination orbit would have been preferred. Further, the
SAA region depends on the sensitivity of the instruments onboard and the size of
the covered region of SAA varies depending upon the required intensity of the
particles. Therefore, 6 degree inclination orbit has been retained.
 Celestial constraints
All the payloads are sensitive to Sun & Moon
o Included angle between camera Axis to Sun greater than 45 degrees.
o Included Angle between bright Earth limb to the payload axis greater
than 12 degrees
o Included angle between camera Axis to Moon greater than 20

Using AstroSat as a broad-band Observatory
So far we have discussed the details of individual payloads on AstroSat and its capabilities. However,
since all these experiment are co-aligned (except SSM) and mostly operate in unison, AstroSat can
effectively conduct broad-band multiwavelength observation from Optical to hard X-rays for select
sources in the sky. Here we explore briefly the nature of such potential investigations.
For correlated variability in soft and hard X-rays use time tagged photons data from SXT and LAXPC.
 Correlated variability in X-ray and UV bands require time tagged data from X-ray instruments
and fastest possible photometric data from UVIT.
115
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
 To study simultaneous broad-band X-ray spectrum from 0.3-150 keV, combine data from SXT,
LAXPC and CZT and perform simultaneous spectral fits in XSPEC (X-ray analysis package).
 Search of Cyclotron absorption feature (usually in ~10 keV to 60 keV ) needs well calibrated
spectral data with high statistics from LAXPC and CZT instruments.
 For constructing multi-frequency spectra (Spectral Energy Distribution) of AGNs, CVs, SNRs etc,
simultaneous observations with all 4 instruments over a time scale less than the variability time
of a source is needed.
ASTROSAT Time sharing plan
Most of the AstroSat observations will be devoted to pointed mode studies of specific
cosmic sources. These objects will be selected based on either proposals of the
Instrument Teams (during the first 2 years) or the Principal Investigator proposals that
have been selected by AstroSat Time Allocation Committee (ATAC). Proposed allocation
of observing time of Astrosat during first 3 years of regular observation, to different
instrument groups and open time to Indian and international scientists is given in table

117
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
 Proposal review process and time allocation
The submitted proposals in each cycle will be subjected to an evaluation process by
the ATAC. If a cycle is set to have a two level hierarchy, then members of the ATAC
may chair subcommittees. The ATAC chairperson is the final authority. (S)he is
assisted in the evaluation process by the members of the ATAC or external experts,
depending on the level of hierarchy (one or two). Note that only the AO cycle has
the choice of operating in a single or a two level hierarchy. The following are the
steps envisaged in the review process:
A) For a cycle having one level hierarchy:
1. ATAC chair will nominate external referees to review the proposals. Comments and
ratings given by the referees are taken into account by the ATAC for the selection of
proposals to which observation time is to be allotted.
2. ATAC Chair with other ATAC members collects the feedback from external referees
and technical comments from the ATC and takes the final call on which of the
proposals are to be allotted time. Each proposal in the final set of selected proposals
is given A, B or C priority. (Normally, A is considered the highest priority and C the
lowest.)
B) For a cycle having two level hierarchy:
1. ATAC Chairperson categorizes proposals submitted (say based on the science
category they fall in) and distributes them to different Sub-TACs.
2. Sub-TAC chair will nominate external referees to review the proposals. (S)he along
with other Sub-TAC members selects proposals from the lot allotted to them as
candidates for allotting observing time. Comments and ratings given by the referees
are taken into account by the Sub-TAC for this selection. Sub-TAC decides a rating
and comments for each proposal.
3. ATAC Chair with other ATAC members collects the feedback from Sub-TACs as well
as technical comments from the ATC and makes the final decision on which of the
Sub-TAC suggested proposals are to be allotted time. Each proposal in the final set
of selected proposals is given A, B or C priority.
When the observations are scheduled for observations, `A' priority proposals are
given preference followed by `B' priority proposals. If any `A' or `B' priority proposals
cannot be scheduled in the ongoing cycle, they will be scheduled in the next cycle.
118
ASTROSAT HANDBOOK
`C' priority proposals which cannot be scheduled in the current cycle will be
discarded.
