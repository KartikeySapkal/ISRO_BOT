          The first experimental mission of ISRO’s
                                    Scramjet Engine towards the realisation of an Air Breathing Propulsion
                                    System was successfully conducted on August 28, 2016 from Satish Dhawan
                                    Space Centre SHAR, Sriharikota.
         

          After a flight of about 300 seconds, the vehicle
                                    touched down in the Bay of Bengal, approximately 320 km from
                                    Sriharikota. The vehicle was successfully tracked during its flight from
                                    the ground stations at Sriharikota. With this flight, critical
                                    technologies such as ignition of air breathing engines at supersonic
                                    speed, holding the flame at supersonic speed, air intake mechanism and
                                    fuel injection systems have been successfully demonstrated.
         

          The Scramjet engine designed by ISRO uses Hydrogen as
                                    fuel and the Oxygen from the atmospheric air as the oxidiser. This test
                                    was the maiden short duration experimental test of ISRO’s Scramjet
                                    engine with a hypersonic flight at Mach 6. ISRO’s Advanced Technology
                                    Vehicle (ATV), which is an advanced sounding rocket, was the solid
                                    rocket booster used for the test of Scramjet engines at supersonic
                                    conditions.  ATV carrying Scramjet engines weighed 3277 kg at
                                    lift-off.
