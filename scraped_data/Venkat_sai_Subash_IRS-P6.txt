RESOURCESAT-1 is the tenth satellite of ISRO in IRS series, intended to not only continue the remote sensing data services provided by IRS-1C and IRS-1D, both of which have far outlived their designed mission lives, but also to vastly enhance the data quality. RESOURCESAT-1 is the most advanced Remote Sensing Satellite built by ISRO as of 2003.
