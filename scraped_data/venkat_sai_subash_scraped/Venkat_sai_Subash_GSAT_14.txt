GSAT-14 is the twenty third geostationary communication satellite of India built by ISRO. The main objectives of GSAT-14 mission are:

i) To augment the In-orbit capacity of Extended C and Ku-band transponders
ii) To provide a platform for new experiments.

The payloads of GSAT-14 are:

    Six extended C-band transponders for Indian mainland and island coverage with 36 dBW Edge Of Coverage- Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EOC-EIRP)
    Six Ku-band transponders covering the mainland India with 51.5 dBW EOC-EIRP
    Two Ka-band Beacons operating at 20.2 GHz and 30.5 GHz to carry out attenuation studies

    Fibre Optic Gyro
    Active Pixel Sun Sensor
    Ka band beacon propagation studies
    Thermal control coating experiments

Some of the new technologies being tested on GSAT-14 are:
