           Mission Objectives
          




            To ensure the data continuity of Ocean
                                        colour and wind vector data to sustain
                                        the operational applications.
           

            To improve the applications, some
                                        additional datasets such as Sea Surface
                                        Temperature and more number of
                                        bands in Optical region for florescence
                                        and in Infrared region for atmospheric
                                        corrections are accommodated.
           

            To develop / improve related algorithms
                                        and data products to serve in well-
                                        established application areas and to
                                        enhance the mission utility.
