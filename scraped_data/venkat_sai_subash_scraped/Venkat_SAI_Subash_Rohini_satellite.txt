           RS-D2 was a 41.5 kg experimental spin stabilized satellite designed with a power
                                        handling capability of 16W .It was launched onboard SLV-3 from SHAR Centre on
                                        April 17, 1983. The Smart Sensor Camera was the primary payload onboard the
                                        satellite. It has sent more than 5000 pictures frames in both visible and
                                        infra-red bands for identification of features and demonstrated the technique of
                                        determination of attitude and orbit using images. The camera had on-board
                                        processing capability to use the data for classifying ground features like
                                        water, vegetation, bare land, clouds and snow.
