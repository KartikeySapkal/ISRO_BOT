IRNSS-1G is the seventh navigation satellite of the seven satellites constituting the IRNSS space segment. Its predecessors, IRNSS-1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E and 1F were launched by PSLV-C22, PSLV-C24, PSLV-C26, PSLV-C27, PSLV-C31 and PSLV-C32 in July 2013, April 2014, October 2014, March 2015, January 2016 and March 2016 respectively. Like all other IRNSS satellites, IRNSS-1G also has a lift-off mass of 1425 kg. The configuration of IRNSS-1G too is the same as IRNSS-1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E and 1F.

Payloads: Like its other IRNSS predecessors, IRNSS-1G also carries two types of payloads - navigation payload and ranging payload. The navigation payload of IRNSS-1G transmits navigation service signals to the users. This payload is operating in L5-band and S-band. A highly accurate Rubidium atomic clock is part of the navigation payload of the satellite. The ranging payload of IRNSS-1G consists of a C-band transponder, which facilitates accurate determination of the range of the satellite.

IRNSS-1G was launched by PSLV-C33 into a sub Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (sub GTO) on April 28, 2016 at 12:50 hrs (IST) from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota.

This is the thirty-fourth consecutively successful mission of PSLV, repeatedly proving its reliability and versatility.
