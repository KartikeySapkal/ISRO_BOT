FOREWORD
Success in space demands perfection. Many of the brilliant achievements
made in this vast. austere environment seem almost miraculous. Behind each
apparent miracle. however. stands the flawless performance of numerous highly
complex systems. All are important. The failure of only one portion of a launch
vehicle or spacecraft may cause failure of an entire mission. But the first to
feel this awesome imperative for perfection are the propulsion systems. especially
the engines. Unless they operate flawlessly first. none of the other systems will
get a chance to perform in space.
Perfection begins in the design of space hardware. This book emphasizes
quality and reliability in the design of propulsion and engine systems. It draws
deeply from the vast knoW-how and experience which have been the essence of
several well-designed. reliable systems of the past and present. And. wi,th a
thoroughness and completeness not previously availabl~. it tells how the present
high state of reliability. gained through years of research and testing. can be
maintained. and perhaps improved. in engines of the future.
As man ventures deeper into space to explore the planets. the search for
perfection in the design of propulsion systems will continue. This book will aid
materially in achieving this goal.

PREFACE
This book intends to build a bridge for the student and the young engineer: to link the rocket
propulsion fundamentals and elements (which are well covered in the literature) with the actual rocket
engine design and development work as it is carried out in industry (which is very little, if at all
covered in literature). The book attempts to further the understanding of the realistic application of
liquid rocket propulsion theories, and to help avoid or at least reduce time and money consuming
errors and disappointments. In so doing, it also attempts to digest and consolidate numerous closely
related subjects, hitherto often treated as separate, bringing them up to date at the same time.
The book was written "on the job" for use by those active in all phases of engine systems
design, development, and application, in industry as well as government agencies. Since it addresses
itself to human beings set out to create new machines, rather than describing machines about to
dominate man, the language chosen may not always be "functional" in the strict sense of the word.
The book presents sufficient detail to familiarize and educate thoroughly those responsible for
various aspects of liquid propellant rocketry, including engine systems design, engine development,
and flight vehicle application. It should enable the rocket engineer to conduct, independently, com
plete or partial engine systems preliminary detail designs and to understand and judge the activities
in, and the problems, limitations, and "facts of life~ of the various subsystems making up a complete
engine system. It also attempts to educate those ultimately interested in specialized subsystems and
component design (thrust chamber, turbopump, control valves, etc.) about their own as well as neigh
boring subsystems and about the complete engine system. This should enable the student to prepare
realistic analytical calculations and design layouts with a long headstart toward the final specialized
deSigns for subsystem production release.
Special emphaSis has been placed on engine flight application to stimulate engine systems and
subsystem deSigners to think in these terms from the outset. The book is intended as a textbook,
with specific consideration of the teacher without industry experience. We hope it will stimulate
those desiring to specialize in the area of a rocket engine subsystem by supplying adequate informa
tion to enable them to benefit fully from the specialized literature. Thus it provides a realistic expert
introduction for those joining the liquid propellant rocket engine field.

flow is diverted from the main fuel feed line, fed
through cooling passages and ejected. The heat

Igniters
These are defined as devices which release
heat and thus initiate ti e reaction of the main
propellants which subsequently sustains itself.
Igniters derive their power from an outside
source or from a limited amount of energy stored

igniter types are discussed below.

In the nozzles, the gas pressure is converted
into kinetic energy (velocity head) with attendant
static pressure drop. The gas now velocity is
maximum upon entering the rotating blades, where
the kinetic energy of the gas is imparted to the
turbine rotor as mechanical energy of rotation.
Ideally, the static pressure of the ga s remains
constant when it passes through the rotating
blades (except for the effects of friction).
2. Velocity-compounded impulse turbine.
Figure 6-9 shows a schematic of this turbine
type. Here, two separate rows of rotating blades
instead of one are used to transfer the kinetic
energy of the gas discharged from the set of sta
tionary nozzles. A row of stationary blades is
placed between the wheels to guide the gas into >

blades, and decreases further as it passes

compounded turbines are considered single
stage, since only one pressure step is involved.
3. Pressure-compounded impulse turbine.-As
shown schematically in figure 6-10, the expan

For both large or small units, reliability is not a

Clustering of liquid rocket engines or, in
other words, subdivision of vehicle thrust into

based on vehicle considerations. Depending on
the method chosen, however, engine design will
be directly affected.
