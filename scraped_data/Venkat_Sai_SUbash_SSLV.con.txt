           About the Launch Vehicle
          

           Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) is a 3 stage Launch Vehicle configured with three Solid Propulsion Stages and liquid propulsion based Velocity Trimming Module (VTM) as a terminal stage.
           SSLV is 2m in diameter and 34m in length with lift off weight of ~120 tonnes. SSLV is capable of launching ~500kg satellite in 500km planar orbit from SDSC/SHAR. The key features of SSLV are Low cost, with low turn-around time, flexibility in accommodating multiple satellites, Launch on demand feasibility, minimal launch infrastructure requirements, etc.
