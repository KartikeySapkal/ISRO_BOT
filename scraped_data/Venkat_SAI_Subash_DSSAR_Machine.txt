            PSLV-C56/DS-SAR Mission is accomplished successfully. PSLV-C56 vehicle launched all seven satellites precisely into their intended orbits
         
          








                    The launch of PSLV-C56 carrying DS-SAR satellite, along with 6 co-passengers from the first
                    launch-pad of SDSC-SHAR, Sriharikota is accomplished successfully on July 30, 2023 at 06:30 hrs IST.

                  

                    PSLV-C56 is configured in its core-alone mode, similar to that of C55. It would launched DS-SAR, a
                    360 kg satellite into a Near-equatorial Orbit (NEO) at 5 degrees inclination and 535 km altitude.
                  

 DS-SAR


                    The DS-SAR satellite is developed under a partnership between DSTA (representing the Government of
                    Singapore) and ST Engineering. Once deployed and operational, it will be used to support the
                    satellite imagery requirements of various agencies within the Government of Singapore. ST
                    Engineering will use it for multi-modal and higher responsiveness imagery and geospatial services
                    for their commercial customers.
                  

                    DS-SAR carries a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) payload developed by Israel Aerospace Industries
                    (IAI). This allows the DS-SAR to provide for all-weather day and night coverage, and capable of
                    imaging at 1m-resolution at full polarimetry.
