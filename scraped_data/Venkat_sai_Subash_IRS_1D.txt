IRS – 1D was launched on September 29, 1997 by PSLV – C1. IRS – 1D, a follow on satellite to IRS – 1C belongs to the second generation of IRS series of Satellites. It has 3 payloads viz., PAN, LISS 3 & WiFS.

It has similar capabilities as IRC – 1C in terms of spatial resolution, spectral bands, stereoscopic imaging, wide field coverage and revisit capability. The improvements carried out in the IRS – 1D satellite taking into account the IRS – 1C experiences have resulted in better quality imageries.

Mission completed during January 2010 after serving for 12 years and 3 months.
