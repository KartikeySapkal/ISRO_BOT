                  Payload Fairing
                

                  There are two variant of payload
																	fairing
																	for GSLV vehicle:
                  
                  1. Diameter of 3.4 m metallic PLF &
                  
                  2. Diameter of 4 m ogive PLF.
                  
                  The payload fairing of GSLV is wider than the
																	rest of the launcher. The fairing provides
																	aerodynamic efficiency and shields the payload from
																	mechanical damage during the atmospheric phase of
																	flight.
                 









                  CUS(Third Stage)
                
                
                  The cryogenic upper stage of GSLV
																	imparts a high velocity to the payload and detaches
																	at the periapsis. This high velocity is
																	characteristic of the Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit.
																	Once the spacecraft reaches the apoapsis of this
																	high eccentricity orbit,
																	it performs a burn using its Spacecraft propulsion
																	to circularise its orbit.
               
                








                  GS2(Second Stage)
                

                  The high thrust hypergolic liquid
																	propellant Vikas engine's newer improved version
																	with a higher chamber pressure is used here. It is
																	activated 150 seconds into flight.
               
                








                  S139 (First Stage):
                
 The first stage of GSLV is ignited
																	at Lift off(To) after the ignition of the four
																	strap-ons occurring at (To-4.8 sec), ensuring their
																	full functionality. This is required in order to
																	extract maximum thrust out of the initial stages.
																	The solid core of the first stage burns for 100
																	seconds while the strap-ons continue to provide
																	thrust for another 40 seconds
                
                








                  L40 (Strap-on Boosters
                
  The GSLV uses 4 liquid strap-on
																	motors. The strap-ons are powered by one Vikas
																	engine each and along with the solid rocket motor
																	core of the first stage, provide an enormous thrust
																	to the launcher.

                 GSLV's primary payloads are INSAT
																class of communication satellites that operate from
																Geostationary orbits and hence are placed in
																Geosynchronous Transfer Orbits by GSLV.
                







                 Payload to LEO (Low Earth
																Orbit) : 6,000 kg
                

                 Further, GSLV's capability of placing
																up to 6 tonnes in Low Earth Orbits broadens the scope of
																payloads from heavy satellites to multiple smaller
																satellites.
                







                 Third Stage: CUS
                

                 Developed under the Cryogenic Upper
																Stage Project (CUSP), the CE-7.5 is India's first
																cryogenic engine, developed by the Liquid Propulsion
																Systems Centre. CE-7.5 has a staged combustion operating
																cycle.

           About the Launch Vehicle
          

           Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark II (GSLV Mk II)
										is
										the launch vehicle developed by India, to launch communication satellites in geo
										transfer orbit using
										cryogenic third stage. Initially Russian GK supplied cryogenic stages were used.
										Later cryogenic stage was indigenously developed and
										inducted in Jan 2014 from GSLV D5 onwards. This operational fourth generation
										launch vehicle is a three stage vehicle with four liquid strap-ons.
										The flight proven indigenously developed Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS), forms the
										third stage of GSLV Mk II. From January 2014,
										the vehicle has achieved six consecutive successes
