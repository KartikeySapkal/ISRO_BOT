            SSLV-D2/EOS-07 Mission is successfully accomplished
           









           The second developmental flight of Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), SSLV-D2 is successfully launched on February 10, 2023 at 09:18 hours IST from the first launch pad at SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota. SSLV-D2 is intended to inject EOS-07, Janus-1 and AzaadiSAT-2 satellites into 450 km circular orbit, in its 15 minutes flight.
           


           SSLV caters to the launch of up to 500 kg satellites to Low Earth Orbits on "launch-on-demand" basis. It provides low-cost access to Space, offers low turn-around time and flexibility in accommodating multiple satellites, and demands minimal launch infrastructure. It is configured with three solid propulsion stages and a velocity terminal module. It is a 34 m tall, 2 m diameter vehicle having a lift-off mass of 120 t.
           


           EOS-07 is 156.3 kg satellite designed, developed and realized by ISRO. New experiments include mm-Wave Humidity Sounder and Spectrum Monitoring Payload. Janus-1, a 10.2 kg satellite belongs to ANTARIS, USA. A 8.7 kg satellite AzaadiSAT-2 is a combined effort of about 750 girl students across India guided by Space Kidz India, Chennai.
