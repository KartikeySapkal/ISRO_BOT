             With a lift off weight of 40 tonnes, the 24 m tall ASLV was configured
                                                as a five stage, all-solid propellant vehicle, with a mission of
                                                orbiting 150 kg class satellites into 400 km circular orbits.
            








               The Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) Programme was
                                                        designed to augment the payload capacity to 150 kg, thrice that
                                                        of SLV-3, for Low Earth Orbits (LEO). While building upon the
                                                        experience gained from the SLV-3 missions, ASLV proved to be a
                                                        low cost intermediate vehicle to demonstrate and validate
                                                        critical technologies, that would be needed for the future
                                                        launch vehicles like strap-on technology, inertial navigation,
                                                        bulbous heat shield, vertical integration and closed loop
                                                        guidance.
              

               Under the ASLV programme four developmental flights were
                                                        conducted. The first developmental flight took place on March
                                                        24, 1987 and the second on July 13, 1988. The third
                                                        developmental flight, ASLV-D3 was successfully launched on May
                                                        20, 1992, when SROSS-C (106 kg) was put into an orbit of 255 x
                                                        430 km. ASLV-D4, launched on May 4, 1994, orbited SROSS-C2
                                                        weighing 106 kg. It had two payloads, Gamma Ray Burst (GRB)
                                                        Experiment and Retarding Potentio Analyser (RPA) and functioned
                                                        for seven years.
