          Reusable Launch Vehicle – Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD)
         
         is one of the most
                technologically
                challenging endeavors of ISRO towards developing essential technologies for a fully
                reusable launch vehicle to enable
                low cost access to space. The configuration of RLV-TD is similar to that of an aircraft
                and combines the complexity
                of both launch vehicles and aircraft. The winged RLV-TD has been configured to act as a
                flying test bed to evaluate
                various technologies, namely, hypersonic flight, autonomous landing and powered cruise
                flight. In future, this vehicle
                will be scaled up to become the first stage of India’s reusable two stage orbital launch
                vehicle.
         
          RLV-TD consists of a fuselage (body), a nose cap, double delta wings and twin
                  vertical tails. It also features symmetrically placed active control surfaces called
                  Elevons and Rudder. This technology demonstrator was boosted to Mach no: 5 by a
                  conventional solid booster (HS9) designed for low burn rate. The selection of
                  materials like special alloys, composites and insulation materials for developing an
                  RLV-TD and the crafting of its parts is very complex and demands highly skilled
                  manpower.
                  Many high technology machinery and test equipment were utilised for building this
                  vehicle.
